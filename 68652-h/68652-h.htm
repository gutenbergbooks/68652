<h2 class="nobreak" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p>Although General Winfield Scott was nicknamed
by the soldiers “Old Fuss and Feathers,” they
intended no disrespect. On the contrary, they loved
him, and asked only that he lead them. No general
ever lived who was more popular with the men in
the ranks. They had every kind of confidence in
him; they knew that “Old Fuss and Feathers”
would look out for them like a father, and would
take them through.</p>

<p>His arrival, all in his showy uniform, upon his
splendid horse, along the lines, was the signal for
cheers and for the bands to strike up “Hail to the
Chief.” At bloody Chapultepec the soldiers crowded
around him and even clasped his knees, so fond they
were of him. And when he addressed them, tears
were in his eyes.</p>

<p>General Scott was close to six feet six inches in
height, and massively built. He was the tallest officer
in the army. His left arm was partially useless,
by reason of two wounds received in the War of
1812, but in full uniform he made a gallant sight
indeed. He never omitted any detail of the uniform,
because he felt that the proper uniform was
required for discipline. He brooked no unnecessary
slouchiness among officers and men; he insisted upon
regulations and hard drilling, and the troops that he
commanded were as fine an army as ever followed
the Flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>While he was strict in discipline, he looked keenly
also after the comforts and privileges of his soldiers.
He realized that unless the soldier in the ranks is
well cared for in garrison and camp he will not do
his best in the field, and that victories are won by the
men who are physically and mentally fit. He did not
succeed in doing away with the old practice of punishment
by blows and by “bucking and gagging,” but
he tried; and toward the ill and the wounded he was
all tenderness.</p>

<p>As a tactician he stands high. His mind worked
with accuracy. He drew up every movement for
every column, after his engineers had surveyed the
field; then he depended upon his officers to follow
out the plans. His general orders for the battle of
Cerro Gordo are cited to-day as model orders. Each
movement took place exactly as he had instructed,
and each movement brought the result that he had
expected; so that after the battle the orders stood as a
complete story of the fight.</p>

<p>His character was noble and generous. He had
certain peculiar ways—he spoke of himself as
“Scott” and like Sam Houston he used exalted
language; he was proud and sensitive, but forgiving
and quick to praise. He prized his country above
everything else, and preferred peace, with honor, to
war. Although he was a soldier, such was his justice
and firmness and good sense that he was frequently
sent by the Government to make peace without force
of arms, along the United States borders. He alone
it was who several times averted war with another
nation.</p>

<p>General Scott should not be remembered mainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
for his battles won. He was the first man of prominence
in his time to speak out against drunkenness
in the army and in civil life. He prepared the first
army regulations and the first infantry tactics. He
was the first great commander to enforce martial law
in conquered territory, by which the conquered people
were protected from abuse. He procured the passage
of that bill, in 1838, which awarded to all officers,
except general officers like himself, an increase
in rations allowance for every five years of service.
The money procured from Mexico was employed by
him in buying blankets and shoes for his soldiers and
in helping the discharged hospital patients; and
$118,000 was forwarded to Washington, to establish
an Army Asylum for disabled enlisted men.
From this fund there resulted the present system of
Soldiers’ Homes.</p>

<p>The Mexican War itself was not a popular war,
among Americans, many of whom felt that it might
have been avoided. Lives and money were expended
needlessly. Of course Mexico had been badgering
the United States; American citizens had been mistreated
and could obtain no justice. But the United
States troops really invaded when they crossed into
southwestern Texas, for Mexico had her rights there.</p>

<p>The war, though, brought glory to the American
soldier. In the beginning the standing army of the
United States numbered only about eight thousand
officers and men, but it was so finely organized and
drilled that regiment for regiment it equalled any
army in the world. The militia of the States could
not be depended upon to enter a foreign country;
they had to be called upon as volunteers. Mexico<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
was prepared with thirty thousand men under arms;
her Regulars were well trained, and her regular army
was much larger than the army of the United States.</p>

<p>When General Zachary Taylor, “Old Rough and
Ready,” advanced with his three thousand five hundred
Regulars (almost half the United States army)
for the banks of the Rio Grande River, he braved
a Mexican army of eight thousand, better equipped
than he was, except in <em>men</em>.</p>

<p>A military maxim says that morale is worth
three men. All through the war it was skill and
spirit and not numbers that counted; quality proved
greater than quantity. “Old Zach,” with seventeen
hundred Regulars, beat six thousand Mexican troops
at Resaca de la Palma. At Buena Vista his four
thousand Volunteers and only four hundred and fifty
or five hundred Regulars repulsed twenty thousand
of the best troops of Mexico. General Scott reached
the City of Mexico with six thousand men who,
fighting five battles in one day, had defeated thirty
thousand. Rarely has the American soldier, both
Regular and Volunteer, so shone as in that war
with Mexico, when the enemy outnumbered three and
four to one, and chose his own positions.</p>

<p>The battles were fought with flint-lock muskets,
loaded by means of a paper cartridge, from which the
powder and ball were poured into the muzzle of the
piece. The American dragoons were better mounted
than the Mexican lancers, and charged harder. The
artillery was the best to be had and was splendidly
served on both sides, but the American guns were
the faster in action.</p>

<p>Thoroughly trained officers and men who had confidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
in each other and did not know when they
were beaten, won the war. Many of the most famous
soldiers in American history had their try-out in
Mexico, where Robert E. Lee and George B.
McClellan were young engineers, U. S. Grant was a
second lieutenant, and Jefferson Davis led the Mississippi
Volunteers. The majority of the regular officers
were West Pointers. General Scott declared
that but for the military education afforded by the
Academy the war probably would have lasted four
or five years, with more defeats than victories, at first.</p>

<p>Thus the Mexican War, like the recent World
War, proved the value of officers and men trained
to the highest notch of efficiency.</p>

<p>In killed and wounded the war with Mexico cost
the United States forty-eight hundred men; but the
deaths from disease were twelve thousand, for the
recruits and the Volunteers were not made to take
care of themselves. In addition, nearly ten thousand
soldiers were discharged on account of ruined health.
All in all the cost of the war, in citizens, footed
twenty-five thousand. The expense in money was
about $130,000,000.</p>

<p>By the war the United States acquired practically
all the country west from northern Texas to the
Pacific Ocean, which means California, Utah, Nevada,
the western half of Colorado and most of New
Mexico and Arizona. This, it must be said, was an
amazing result, for in the outset we had claimed only
Texas, as far as the Rio Grande River.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WORDS">WORDS OF GENERAL SCOTT</h2>
</div>


<p>His motto in life: “If idle, be not solitary; if solitary, be
not idle.”</p>

<p>At Queenstown Heights, 1812: “Let us, then, die, arms in
hand. Our country demands the sacrifice. The example will
not be lost. The blood of the slain will make heroes of
the living.”</p>

<p>At Chippewa, July 5, 1814: “Let us make a new anniversary
for ourselves.”</p>

<p>To the Eleventh Infantry at Chippewa: “The enemy say
that Americans are good at long shot, but cannot stand the
cold iron. I call upon the Eleventh instantly to give the lie
to that slander. Charge!”</p>

<p>From an inscription in a Peace Album, 1844: “If war be
the natural state of savage tribes, peace is the first want of
every civilized community.”</p>

<p>At Vera Cruz, March, 1847, when warned not to expose
himself: “Oh, generals, nowadays, can be made out of anybody;
but <em>men</em> cannot be had.”</p>

<p>At Chapultepec, 1847: “Fellow soldiers! You have this
day been baptized in blood and fire, and you have come
out steel!”</p>

<p>To the Virginia commissioners, 1861: “I have served my
country under the flag of the Union for more than fifty years,
and, so long as God permits me to live, I will defend that flag
with my sword, even if my own native State assails it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WAR">THE WAR WITH MEXICO (1846–1847)</h2>
</div>


<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">The Causes</span></h3>

<p>March 2, 1836, by people’s convention the Mexican province
of Texas declares its independence and its intention to become
a republic.</p>

<p>April 21, 1836, by the decisive battle of San Jacinto, Texas
wins its war for independence, in which it has been assisted
by many volunteers from the United States.</p>

<p>May 14, 1836, Santa Anna, the Mexican President and
general who had been captured after the battle, signs a treaty
acknowledging the Texas Republic, extending to the Rio
Grande River.</p>

<p>September, 1836, in its first election Texas favors annexation
to the United States.</p>

<p>December, 1836, the Texas Congress declares that the
southwestern and western boundaries of the republic are the
Rio Grande River, from its mouth to its source.</p>

<p>The government of Mexico refuses to recognize the independence
of Texas, and claims that as a province its boundary
extends only to the Nueces River, which empties into the
Gulf of Mexico, about 120 miles from the mouth of the
Rio Grande.</p>

<p>This spring and summer petitions have been circulated
through the United States in favor of recognizing the Republic
of Texas. Congress has debated upon that and upon annexation.
The South especially desires the annexation, in order
to add Texas to the number of slave-holding States.</p>

<p>February, 1837, President Andrew Jackson, by message
to Congress, relates that Mexico has not observed a treaty of
friendship signed in 1831, and has committed many outrages
upon the Flag and the citizens of the United States; has
refused to make payments for damages and deserves “immediate
war” but should be given another chance.</p>

<p>March, 1837, the United States recognizes the independence
of the Texas Republic.</p>

<p>Mexico has resented the support granted to Texas by
the United States and by American citizens; she insists that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Texas is still a part of her territory; and from this time
onward there is constant friction between her on the one side
and Texas and the United States on the other.</p>

<p>In August, 1837, the Texas minister at Washington presents
a proposition from the new republic for annexation to the
United States. This being declined by President Martin
Van Buren in order to avoid war with Mexico, Texas decides
to wait.</p>

<p>Mexico continues to evade treaties by which she should
pay claims against her by the United States for damages.
In December, 1842, President John Tyler informs Congress
that the rightful claims of United States citizens have been
summed at $2,026,079, with many not yet included.</p>

<p>Several Southern States consider resolutions favoring the
annexation of Texas. The sympathies of both North and
South are with Texas against Mexico.</p>

<p>In August, and again in November, 1843, Mexico notifies
the United States that the annexation of Texas, which is still
looked upon as only a rebellious province, will be regarded
as an act of war.</p>

<p>October, 1843, the United States Secretary of State invites
Texas to present proposals for annexation.</p>

<p>In December, 1843, President Tyler recommends to Congress
that the United States should assist Texas by force
of arms.</p>

<p>April 12, 1844, John C. Calhoun, the Secretary of State,
concludes a treaty with Texas, providing for annexation.
There is fear that Great Britain is about to gain control of
Texas by arbitrating between it and Mexico. The treaty is
voted down by the Senate on the ground that it would mean
war with Mexico, would bring on a boundary dispute, and
that to make a new State out of foreign territory was
unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Throughout 1844 the annexation of Texas is a burning
question, debated in Congress and by the public. In the
presidential election this fall the annexation is supported by
the Democratic party and opposed by the Whig party. The
Democrats had nominated James K. Polk for President,
George M. Dallas for Vice-President; the Democrats’ campaign
banners read: “Polk, Dallas and Texas!” Polk and
Dallas are elected.</p>

<p>March 1, 1845, a joint resolution of Congress inviting
Texas into the Union as a State is signed by President Tyler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
just before he gives way to President-elect Polk. The boundaries
of Texas are not named.</p>

<p>March 6 General Almonte, Mexican minister to the United
States, denounces the resolution as an act of injustice to a
friendly nation and prepares to leave Washington.</p>

<p>March 21 orders are issued by President Polk to General
Zachary Taylor to make ready for marching the troops at
Fort Jesup, western Louisiana, into Texas.</p>

<p>This same month the Texas Secretary of State has submitted
to Mexico a treaty of peace by which Mexico shall
recognize the republic of Texas, if Texas shall not unite with
any other power.</p>

<p>In May, this 1845, Mexico signs the treaty with Texas.</p>

<p>May 28 the President of the United States directs General
Taylor to prepare his command for a prompt defence of Texas.</p>

<p>June 4 President Anson Jones, of the Texas Republic,
proclaims that by the treaty with Mexico hostilities between
the two countries have ended. But—</p>

<p>June 15 President Polk, through the Secretary of War,
directs General Taylor to move his troops at once, as a
“corps of observation,” into Texas and establish headquarters
at a point convenient for a further advance to the Rio Grande
River. A strong squadron of the navy also is ordered to the
Mexican coast. And—</p>

<p>June 21 the Texas Congress unanimously rejects the
treaty with Mexico, and on June 23 unanimously accepts annexation
to the United States.</p>

<p>July 4, this 1845, in public convention the people of Texas
draw up an annexation ordinance and a State constitution.</p>

<p>On July 7 Texas asks the United States to protect her ports
and to send an army for her defence.</p>

<p>August 3 General Zachary Taylor lands an army of 1500
men at the mouth of the Nueces River, and presently makes
his encampment at Corpus Christi, on the farther shore.</p>

<p>In October the Mexican Government, under President
Herrera, agrees to receive a commissioner sent by the United
States to discuss the dispute over Texas, and President Polk
withdraws the ships that have been stationed at Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>December 6, 1845, John Slidell, the envoy from the United
States, arrives in the City of Mexico to adjust the matter of
Texas and also the claims held by American citizens
against Mexico.</p>

<p>The Mexican Republic is in the throes of another revolution.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
It declines to include the claims in the proposed discussion;
December 30 President Herrera is ousted and Don
Maria Paredes, who favors war rather than the loss of Texas,
becomes head of the republic. Minister Slidell finally has to
return home, in March, 1846. But long before this President
Polk had decided to seize the disputed Texas boundary strip.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Taylor’s Campaign</span></h3>

<p>January 13, 1846, General Taylor is directed by the President
to advance and occupy the left or Texas bank of the Rio
Grande River; he has been reinforced by recruits, and is
authorized to apply to the Southern States for volunteer troops.</p>

<p>March 8 the first detachment is started forward to cross the
disputed strip between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande.
Other detachments follow. Part way General Taylor is officially
warned by a Mexican officer that a farther advance will
be deemed a hostile act. He proceeds, with his 4000 Regulars
(half the army of the United States), and establishes a base
of supplies at Point Isabel, on the Gulf shore, about thirty
miles this side of the Rio Grande River.</p>

<p>March 28 the American army of now 3500 men, called the
Army of Occupation, encamps a short distance above the
mouth of the Rio Grande River, opposite the Mexican town
of Matamoros and 119 miles from the mouth of the Nueces.</p>

<p>The Mexican forces at Matamoros immediately commence
the erection of new batteries and the American force begins
a fort.</p>

<p>April 10 Colonel Truman Cross, assistant quartermaster
general in the American army, is murdered by Mexican bandits.</p>

<p>April 12 General Ampudia, of the Mexican forces at
Matamoros, serves notice upon General Taylor either to withdraw
within twenty-four hours and return to the Nueces out
of the disputed territory, or else accept war. General Taylor
replies that his orders are for him to remain here until the
boundary dispute is settled. He announced a blockade of the
Rio Grande River.</p>

<p>April 19 Second Lieutenant Theodoric Henry Porter,
Fourth Infantry, is killed in action with Mexican guerillas.</p>

<p>April 25, this 1846, occurs the first battle of the war, when
at La Rosia a squadron of sixty-three Second Dragoons under
Captain Seth B. Thornton, reconnoitering up the Rio Grande
River, is surrounded by 500 Mexican regular cavalry. Second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Lieutenant George T. Mason and eight enlisted men are
killed, two men wounded, Captain Thornton, two other officers
and forty-six men are captured.</p>

<p>By this victory the Mexicans are much elated; the flame
of war is lighted in the United States.</p>

<p>May 11 President Polk announces a state of war, and a
bloody invasion of American soil by the Mexican forces that
had crossed the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>May 13 Congress passes a bill authorizing men and money
with which to carry on the war, and declaring that the war
has been begun by Mexico. There were objections to the bill
on the ground that the President had ordered troops into the
disputed territory without having consulted Congress, and
that war might have been avoided. But all parties agree that
now they must support the Flag.</p>

<p>General Taylor calls on the governors of Louisiana and
Texas for 5000 volunteers.</p>

<p>April 28 Captain Samuel Walker and some seventy Texas
Rangers and Volunteers are attacked and beaten by 1500
Mexican soldiers near Point Isabel, the American base of supplies.
Captain Walker and six men make their way to General
Taylor with report that his line of communication has been cut.</p>

<p>May 1, having almost completed the fort opposite Matamoros
above the mouth of the Rio Grande, General Taylor
leaves a garrison of 1000 men and marches in haste to rescue
his supplies at Point Isabel. The Mexican troops are appearing
in great numbers, and matters look serious for the little
American army.</p>

<p>May 3 the Mexican forces at Matamoros open fire upon
the fort, thinking that General Taylor has retreated.</p>

<p>May 8 General Taylor, hurrying back to the relief of the
fort, with his 2300 men defeats 6500 Mexicans under General
Arista in the artillery battle of Palo Alto or Tall Timber,
fought amidst the thickets and prairie grasses about sixteen
miles from Point Isabel. American loss, four killed, forty
wounded; Mexican loss, more than 100 in killed alone.</p>

<p>The next day, May 9, “Old Rough and Ready” again
defeats General Arista in the battle of Resaca de la Palma,
or Palm Draw (Ravine), a short distance from Palo Alto.
Having withstood a fierce bombardment of seven days the fort,
soon named Fort Brown, of present Brownsville, Texas, is safe.
The Mexican forces all flee wildly across the Rio Grande River.</p>

<p>May 18 General Taylor throws his army across the river<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
by help of one barge, and occupies Matamoros. Here he
awaits supplies and troops.</p>

<p>August 20 he begins his advance into Mexico for the capture
of the city of Monterey, 150 miles from the Rio Grande
River and 800 miles from the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Paredes, president of Mexico, has
been deposed by another revolution, and General Santa Anna
has been called back.</p>

<p>September 21–22–23 General Taylor with his 6600 men
assaults the fortified city Monterey, in the Sierra Madre
Mountains of northeastern Mexico, and defended by 10,000
Mexican soldiers under General Ampudia.</p>

<p>September 24 the city is surrendered. American loss, 120
officers and men killed, 368 wounded; Mexican loss, more
than 1000.</p>

<p>General Taylor proceeds to occupy northeastern Mexico.
In November he receives orders to detach 4000 men, half of
whom shall be Regulars, for the reinforcement of General
Scott’s expedition against Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>February 22, 1847, with 4300 Volunteers and 450 Regulars
he encounters the full army of General Santa Anna, 20,000 men,
at the narrow mountain pass of Buena Vista, near Saltillo
seventy-five miles southwest of Monterey.</p>

<p>The American army, holding the pass, awaits the attack.
In the terrible battle begun in the afternoon of February 22
and waged all day February 23, the Mexican troops are repulsed;
and by the morning of February 24 they have
retreated from the field. American loss, 267 killed, 456
wounded, 23 missing; Mexican loss, 2000.</p>

<p>The battle of Buena Vista leaves the American forces in
possession of northeastern Mexico. General Santa Anna now
hastens to confront General Scott and save the City of
Mexico. General Taylor returns to Louisiana, and there is no
further need for his services in the field.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Scott’s Campaign</span></h3>

<p>March 9, 1847, General Winfield Scott, with the assistance
of the naval squadron under Commodore Conner, lands his
Army of Invasion, 12,000 men transferred in sixty-seven
surf-boats, upon the beach three miles below the fortified city
of Vera Cruz, without loss or accident.</p>

<p>In spite of shot and shell and terrific wind storms the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
army advances its trenches and guns to within 800 yards of the
city walls. On March 22 the bombardment of Vera Cruz
is begun.</p>

<p>March 27 the surrender of the city and of the great
island fort San Juan de Ulloa is accepted. The siege has been
so scientifically conducted that 5000 military prisoners and
400 cannon are taken with the loss to the American forces of
only sixty-four officers and men killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Having been detained at Vera Cruz by lack of wagons
and teams, on April 8 General Scott starts his first detachment
for Mexico City, 280 miles by road westward.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><i>The March to the City of Mexico, 279 Miles</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>April 12, arrangements being completed, he hastens to the
front himself and is received with cheers for “Old Fuss
and Feathers” all along the way.</p>

<p>April 18 storms and captures the heights of Cerro Gordo,
sixty miles inland, where his 8000 men are opposed by 12,000
under Santa Anna. Three thousand prisoners, among them
five generals, are taken; 5000 stands of arms and forty-three
pieces of artillery. American loss, 431, thirty-three being
officers; Mexican casualties, over 1000.</p>

<p>April 19 he occupies the town of Jalapa, fifteen miles
onward. April 22 the castle of Perote, some fifty miles farther,
is captured without a struggle. On May 15 the advance
division of 4300 men enters the city of Puebla, 185 miles from
Vera Cruz. In two months General Scott has taken 10,000
prisoners of war, 700 cannon, 10,000 stands of small-arms,
30,000 shells and solid shot.</p>

<p>The term of enlistment of 4000 twelve-months Volunteers
being almost expired, he waits in Puebla for reinforcements.</p>

<p>August 7 he resumes the march for the Mexican capital,
ninety-five miles. His force numbers 10,800, and he needs
must cut loose from communications with Vera Cruz, his base.</p>

<p>August 9, from Rio Frio Pass, elevation 10,000 feet, on the
summit of the main mountain range of Mexico, the army gazes
down into the Valley of Mexico, with the city of Mexico
visible, thirty-five miles distant.</p>

<p>By a new and difficult route he avoids the defences of the
main road to the city, and on August 18 has approached to
within nine miles and striking distance of the outer circle
of batteries.</p>

<p>August 19–20, by day and night attack, 3500 Americans
carry the strong entrenchments of Contreras defended by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
7000 Mexicans. American loss, in killed and wounded, 60;
Mexican casualties, 700 killed, 1000 wounded.</p>

<p>The same day, August 20, 1847, the outpost of San
Antonio is taken, the high citadel of Churubusco stormed.
There are five separate actions, all victorious, and the dragoons
charge four miles to the very gates of the city. Thirty-two
thousand men have been defeated by 8000. The total
Mexican loss is 4000 killed and wounded, 3000 prisoners, including
eight generals; the American loss is 1052, of whom
seventy-six are officers.</p>

<p>August 21 President and General Santa Anna proposes
an armistice.</p>

<p>September 7 the armistice is broken and General Scott
resumes his advance upon the city.</p>

<p>September 8 the General Worth division, reinforced to
3000 men, in a bloody battle captures the outpost Molino del
Rey or King’s Mill, and the Casa-Mata supporting it—the two
being defended by 14,000 Mexicans. American loss, killed,
wounded and missing is 789, including fifty-eight officers.
The Mexican loss is in the thousands.</p>

<p>September 12, by a feint the Scott army of 7000 able-bodied
men is concentrated before the Castle of Chapultepec,
situated upon a high hill fortified from base to summit and
crowned by the Military College of Mexico, with its garrison
of cadets and experienced officers.</p>

<p>September 13 Chapultepec is stormed and seized; the road
to the city is opened, the suburbs are occupied and the General
Quitman division has forced the Belen gateway into the city
itself. Twenty thousand Mexicans have been routed.</p>

<p>At daybreak of September 14 the city council of Mexico
informs General Scott that the Mexican Government and army
have fled. At seven o’clock the Stars and Stripes are raised
over the National Palace and the American army of 6000
proceeds to enter the grand plaza.</p>

<p>This fall of 1847 there is still some fighting in the country
along the National Road between Vera Cruz and the City of
Mexico, and the fleeing Santa Anna attacks Puebla in vain.</p>

<p>February 2, 1848, a treaty of peace is signed at Guadaloupe
Hidalgo by the United States commissioner and the
Mexican commissioners.</p>

<p>May 30, 1848, the treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo is ratified
by both parties.</p>

<p>June 19, 1848, peace is formally declared by President
Polk, who on July 4 signs the treaty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Other Campaigns</span></h3>

<p>At the end of June, 1846, the Army of the West, composed
of 2500 Volunteers and 200 First Dragoons, under General
Stephen W. Kearny, leaves Fort Leavenworth on the Missouri
River to march 1000 miles and seize New Mexico.</p>

<p>August 18 General Kearny enters the capital, Santa Fé,
and takes possession of New Mexico.</p>

<p>This same month the Army of the Center, 2500 Volunteers
and 500 Regulars under General John E. Wool, assembles
at San Antonio of Texas for a march westward to seize
Chihuahua, northwestern Mexico, distant 400 miles.</p>

<p>General Wool is ordered to join General Scott; but in
December, 1846, Colonel A. W. Doniphan, of the Missouri
Volunteers of the Kearny army, leaves Santa Fé with 800
men to march to Chihuahua, 550 miles, and reinforce him.</p>

<p>December 25 he defeats General Ponce de Leon, commanding
500 Mexican regular lancers and 800 Chihuahua volunteers,
in the battle of Brazitos, southern New Mexico.</p>

<p>February 28, 1848, in the battle of Sacramento, he defeats
General Heredia and 4000 men, entrenched on the road to
Chihuahua. American loss, one killed, eleven wounded; Mexican
loss, 320 killed, over 400 wounded.</p>

<p>On March 1 the American advance enters the city of
Chihuahua.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during all these events, on July 7, 1846,
Commodore John D. Sloat, of the navy’s Pacific Squadron, has
hoisted the Flag over Monterey, the capital of Upper California.
The explorer, John C. Fremont, already has supported
an uprising of Americans in the north, and the flag is raised
at San Francisco and Sacramento.</p>

<p>On September 25 (1846) General Kearny starts from Santa
Fé with 400 First Dragoons to occupy California, 1100 miles
westward. On the way he learns that California has been
taken. He proceeds with only 100 Dragoons. A battalion of
500 Mormons enlisted at Fort Leavenworth is following.</p>

<p>December 12 he arrives at San Diego, California, and
forthwith military rule is established in California.</p>

<a href="#i_027">WINFIELD SCOTT</a></h2>
</div>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">Old Fuss and Feathers</span>”</h3>


<p>Born on the family farm, fourteen miles from Petersburg,
Virginia, June 13, 1786.</p>

<p>His father, William Scott, of Scotch blood, a captain in
the Revolution and a successful farmer, dies when Winfield
is only six years old. Until he is seventeen the boy is brought
up by his mother, Ann Mason, for whose brother, Winfield
Mason, he is named. All the Scott family connections were
prominent and well-to-do.</p>

<p>Winfield is given a good education. When he is twelve he
enters the boarding-school of James Hargrave, a worthy
Quaker, who said to him after the War of 1812: “Friend
Winfield, I always told thee not to fight; but as thou wouldst
fight, I am glad that thou weren’t beaten.” When he is seventeen
he enters the school, of high-school grade, conducted in
Richmond, Virginia, by James Ogilvie, a talented Scotchman.
Here he studied Latin and Greek, rhetoric, Scotch metaphysics,
logic, mathematics and political economy.</p>

<p>In 1805, when he is approaching nineteen, he enters
William and Mary College, of Virginia. Here he studies
chemistry, natural and experimental philosophy, and law,
expecting to become a lawyer.</p>

<p>This same year he leaves college and becomes a law
student in the office of David Robinson, in Petersburg. He
has two companion students: Thomas Ruffin and John F. May.
The three lads all rose high. Thomas Ruffin became chief
justice of North Carolina; John May became leader of the bar
in southern Virginia; Winfield Scott became head of the
United States Army.</p>

<p>In 1806 he is admitted to the bar and rides his first
circuit in Virginia. At Richmond, in 1807, he hears the arguments
by the greatest legal orators of the day in the trial
of ex-Vice-President Aaron Burr for high treason.</p>

<p>While the trial is in progress the British frigate <i>Leopard</i>
enforces the right of search upon the United States frigate
<i>Chesapeake</i>, off the capes of Virginia. On July 2 (1807)
President Thomas Jefferson forbids the use of the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
States harbors and rivers by the vessels of Great Britain, and
volunteer guards are called for to patrol the shores.</p>

<p>Young Lawyer Scott, now twenty-one years of age,
becomes, as he says, “a soldier in a night.” Between sunset
and sunrise he travels by horse twenty-five miles, from Richmond
to Petersburg, and having borrowed the uniform of
a tall absent trooper and bought the horse he joins the first
parade of the Petersburg volunteer cavalry.</p>

<p>While lance corporal in charge of a picket guard on the
shore of Lynnhaven Bay he captures a boat crew of six sailors
under two midshipmen, coming in from Admiral Sir Thomas
Hardy’s British squadron for water. The Government orders
him to release the prisoners, and not to do such a trick again,
which might bring on war.</p>

<p>England having made amends for the attack upon the
Chesapeake the volunteers are disbanded. Corporal Scott resumes
his practice of law. On Christmas Eve, 1807, he arrives
in Charleston, South Carolina, to practice there. But he hears
that war with Great Britain is again likely. Thereupon he
hastens to Washington and applies for a commission in the
increased regular army. He is promised a captaincy.</p>

<p>The Peace Party in the United States gains the upper
hand over the War Party. In March, 1808, Lawyer Scott
returns to Petersburg without his commission.</p>

<p>May 3, 1808, he receives his commission at last, and is
appointed to a captaincy in the regiment of light or flying artillery
then being raised. He recruits his company from Petersburg
and Richmond youths and is ordered to New Orleans.
For the next fifty-three years he is a soldier, and he outlives
every other officer of 1808.</p>

<p>After a voyage of two months in a sailing vessel he arrives
at New Orleans April 1, 1809.</p>

<p>The trouble with Great Britain having quieted down this
summer, he despairs of seeing active service and attempts to
resign. While in New Orleans he has said that he believed
General James Wilkinson, commanding that department, to
have been a partner of Aaron Burr in the conspiracy against
the United States government. Now when he arrives in Virginia
he hears that he is accused of having left the army
through fear of punishment for his words. So he immediately
turns about and goes back to face the charges. He rejoins
the army at Washington, near Natchez, Mississippi,
in November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>In 1810 he is court-martialed under the Articles of War
and found guilty of “conduct unbecoming a gentleman,” in
having spoken disrespectfully of his commanding officer. He
is sentenced to twelve months’ suspension from duties, with
the recommendation that nine of the months be remitted.</p>

<p>Under this sentence he returns to Petersburg. He spends
every evening, when at home, reading English literature with
his friend Benjamin Watkins Leigh, in whose family he is
staying. His motto is: “If idle, be not solitary; if solitary,
be not idle.” During this period he again despairs of seeing
active service; but he writes: “Should war come at last, who
knows but that I may yet write my history with my sword?”</p>

<p>In the fall of 1811 he rejoins the army at department headquarters
at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, having made the journey
by land over a new road through the country of the Creeks
and Choctaws.</p>

<p>This winter of 1811–1812 he is appointed superior judge-advocate
for the trial of a prominent colonel. He also serves
upon the staff of Brigadier General Wade Hampton, commander
of the Southern Department, and is much in
New Orleans.</p>

<p>The inactive life of a soldier in peace palls upon him. In
February, 1812, the news arrives that Congress has authorized
an increase of the regular army by 25,000 men. This looks
like war. May 20, as a member of General Hampton’s staff,
he embarks with the general for Washington. Upon entering
Chesapeake Bay their ship passes a British frigate standing
on and off; in less than an hour they pass a pilot boat bringing
to the frigate the message that the United States has
declared for war with Great Britain. Thus by a narrow
margin they have escaped capture by the frigate.</p>

<p>July 6, 1812, is appointed lieutenant-colonel, Second
Artillery, at the age of twenty-six.</p>

<p>Is ordered with his regiment to the Canadian border;
reports at Buffalo October 4, 1812.</p>

<p>On October 13 leads 450 regulars and militia in a final
attack upon Queenstown Heights, opposite Lewiston, New
York. The Heights are held by a greatly superior force of
British regulars and militia and 500 Indians. The United
States militia left on the American side of the Niagara River
refused to cross and support, and the attack failed for lack
of reinforcements. There were no boats for retreat; two
flags of truce had been unheeded; with his own hand young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Lieutenant-Colonel Scott, tall and powerful and wearing a
showy uniform (“I will die in my robes,” he said), bears
the third flag forward into the faces of the raging Indians
to save his men. He is rescued with difficulty by British officers.
After the surrender he is held prisoner with the
other Regulars until paroled on November 20 and sent
to Boston.</p>

<p>In January, 1813, is released from parole. Is ordered to
Philadelphia to command a double battalion of twenty-two
companies.</p>

<p>March 12, 1813, promoted to colonel, Second Artillery.</p>

<p>March 18, appointed adjutant general, rank of colonel.</p>

<p>May, 1813, appointed chief of staff to Major-General Henry
Dearborn on the Niagara frontier, New York, and reorganizes
the staff departments of the Army.</p>

<p>May 27 commands the advance again in the attack on
Fort George, Canada. Every fifth man is killed or wounded.
By the explosion of a powder magazine his collar-bone is
broken and he is badly bruised; but he is the first to enter
the fort and he himself hauls down the colors.</p>

<p>July 18 he resigns his adjutant generalcy in order to
be with his regiment as colonel. Leads in several successful
skirmishes.</p>

<p>March 9, 1814, aged twenty-eight, is appointed brigadier-general.
He has become noted as a student of war—a skilful
tactician and a fine disciplinarian. At the Buffalo headquarters
he is set at work instructing the officers. The United
States has no military text-book, but he has read the French
system of military training and employs that.</p>

<p>July 3, 1814, leads with his brigade to the attack upon
Fort Erie, opposite Buffalo. Leaps from the first boat into
water over his head, and laden with sword, epaulets, cloak
and high boots swims for his life under a hot fire, until he
can be hauled in again. The fort is captured.</p>

<p>July 4, again leading his brigade he drives the enemy back
sixteen miles.</p>

<p>July 5 fights and wins the decisive battle of Chippewa
against a much superior force. The war on the land had
been going badly for the United States. Now the victory
of Chippewa sets bonfires to blazing and bells to ringing
throughout all the Republic; the American army had proved
itself with the bayonet and General Scott is hailed as the
National hero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>July 25 he distinguishes himself again in the night battle
of Niagara or Lundy’s Lane. He is twice dismounted, and
is bruised by a spent cannon ball. Receives an ounce musket
ball through the left shoulder and is insensible for a time.
Is borne from the field in an ambulance.</p>

<p>July 25 brevetted major-general for gallantry at Chippewa
and Lundy’s Lane.</p>

<p>The wound in his shoulder refuses to heal properly. He is
invalided and is unable to take part in further active service
for the rest of the war. Travels upon a mattress in a carriage.
Stops at Princeton College on Commencement Day, is given an
ovation and the degree of Master of Arts. Congress votes
him a special gold medal; the States of Virginia and New
York vote him each a sword. His wound slowly heals under
treatment by noted surgeons, but leaves him with a left arm
partially paralyzed.</p>

<p>He is placed in charge of operations in defence of Baltimore
and is made president of the National Board of Tactics,
sitting in Washington.</p>

<p>After the close of the war he presides, May, 1815, upon
the board convened to reduce the army.</p>

<p>Declines to accept the office of Secretary of War.</p>

<p>July, 1815, sails for Europe, where he witnesses the reviews
of 600,000 soldiers, following the defeat of Napoleon by
the allied troops. He meets distinguished commanders and
statesmen of the Old World, and is awarded many honors.</p>

<p>Returning from Europe in 1816 he marries Miss Maria
Mayo, of Richmond, Virginia. Seven children—five girls and
two boys—were born. Of these, four died early in life.</p>

<p>As brigadier-general, in 1818, he begins the preparation of
a system of General Regulations or Military Institutes for the
United States Army. This was approved of by the War
Department and Congress.</p>

<p>September 22, 1824, he writes and has printed “A Scheme
for Restricting the Use of Ardent Spirits in the United States.”
This essay was the basis of the temperance movement in
the country.</p>

<p>In 1824 is president of the Board of Infantry Tactics,
meeting at West Point.</p>

<p>In 1826 is president of a board of militia officers and
regular officers, convened at Washington to devise an organization
and system of tactics for the militia of the United States.</p>

<p>In 1828, while inspecting the Indian frontier of Arkansas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and Louisiana, is approved of by the cabinet for appointment
to commander-in-chief of the army, but loses to General
Alexander Macomb.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1832 is ordered from his Eastern Department
to proceed in person against the Sacs and Foxes under
Chief Blackhawk, in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin.
The cholera is raging in the Great Lakes region. Before leaving
New York he takes instructions from a doctor, and when
his force is attacked by the disease on the boats he himself
applies the remedies and prevents a panic.</p>

<p>Arrives at Fort Crawford, Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin,
after Blackhawk’s surrender. Descends the Mississippi to
Fort Armstrong, on Rock Island, and holds grand council
with the Sacs, Foxes, Sioux, Menominees and Winnebagos.
Is congratulated by the Secretary of War for his services and
his high moral courage in combating the cholera.</p>

<p>On his way home to West Point he narrowly escapes a
severe attack of the cholera himself.</p>

<p>November, 1832, is sent to South Carolina, which has
threatened to secede unless the tariff laws of the Government
are modified. General Scott takes command in Charleston,
and by his firmness and good sense among his fellow Southerners
averts civil war.</p>

<p>In 1834–1835 translates and revises the new French infantry
tactics for use by the United States. These, known as
“Scott’s Infantry Tactics,” were the first complete tactics
adopted by the army and were used up to 1863.</p>

<p>January 20, 1836, is directed by the President to proceed
against the Seminole Indians of Florida. Asked at four in
the afternoon when he could start, he says: “This night.”
Through failure of supplies and by reason of the short-time
enlistment of the majority of the troops, the campaign is unsuccessful.
For this, and for a similar delay in a march against
the Creeks, he is court-martialed by order of President Jackson.
The court approves of his campaign plans and acquits him.
Returning to his headquarters in New York he is tendered
a public dinner April, 1837. This he declines.</p>

<p>January, 1838, is ordered to the Niagara frontier again,
where misguided Americans and Canadians are attempting
a movement to annex Canada to the United States. In dead of
winter he travels back and forth along the American border,
quieting the people by his words and the force of his presence.</p>

<p>In the spring of this 1838 he is sent into Alabama to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
remove the Cherokee Indians to new lands given them by
treaty, west of the Mississippi River. The Indians had refused
to go, but by using reason and gentleness he avoids bloodshed
and persuades them to move of their own accord.</p>

<p>In February, 1839, is sent by the President as special
agent to northern Maine, where the State of Maine and the
Canadian province of New Brunswick are in arms against each
other over a dispute upon the boundary between. Again by
his rare good judgment and by his influence with the authorities
upon either side, he averts what might easily have resulted
in another war.</p>

<p>In 1840 he is proposed as the Whig candidate for President,
but he declines in favor of General William Henry
Harrison, who is elected.</p>

<p>June 25, 1841, appointed full major-general.</p>

<p>July 5, 1841, appointed chief of the Army, a position that
he occupies for twenty years.</p>

<p>From 1841 to 1846 is busied with the duties of his office.
He aims to enforce justice and discipline among the rank and
file. August, 1842, he issues general orders forbidding the
practice of officers striking enlisted men and cursing them, and
directs that in cases of offense the regulations of the service
be employed.</p>

<p>In the summer and fall of 1846, believing that the campaign
by General Zachary Taylor to conquer Mexico by invasion
from the Rio Grande River border cannot succeed, he
advises an advance upon the City of Mexico from Vera Cruz
on the Gulf. He asks permission to lead the army in person.</p>

<p>November 23, 1846, he is directed by the Secretary of
War to conduct the new campaign.</p>

<p>Leaves Washington for New Orleans November 25.</p>

<p>In his absence a bill is introduced in Congress to create
the rank of lieutenant-general, and thus place over him a
superior officer. This movement for politics was defeated,
but General Scott felt that he had “an enemy in his rear.”</p>

<p>Under these conditions he goes to meet General Taylor
at the Rio Grande in January, 1847, and detaches a portion
of the forces for the Vera Cruz campaign. This makes an
enemy of General Taylor.</p>

<p>February 19, 1847, he issues general orders declaring
martial law in Mexico, for the purpose of restraining the
Volunteers from abusing the people of the conquered territory.
This wins over the natives and restores discipline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>March 9 to September 14, 1847, he conducts the campaign
by which the City of Mexico, is captured.</p>

<p>September 14, 1847, to February 18, 1848, he remains in
charge of the military government in Mexico. By his enforcement
of martial law that respects the persons and property
of the Mexican people he gains the leaders’ confidence.
He is proposed for dictator of the Mexican Republic, with
a view to annexation to the United States, but declines.</p>

<p>February 18, 1848, he receives orders from President Polk
to turn over his command to Major-General William O. Butler,
and report for trial by a court of inquiry, on charges that he
had unjustly disciplined Generals Quitman and Pillow, and
Lieutenant-Colonel Duncan. He is acquitted.</p>

<p>March 9, by joint resolution of Congress, he is voted the
National thanks for himself and his officers and men, and
the testimony of a specially struck gold medal in appreciation
of his “valor, skill and judicious conduct.”</p>

<p>May 20, 1848, he arrives home to his family at Elizabeth,
near Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Is assigned to command of the Eastern Department of the
Army, with headquarters in New York.</p>

<p>In 1850, after the death of President Taylor, he resumes
his post in Washington as commander-in-chief of the Army.</p>

<p>In 1850 he is awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. by
Columbia College (University).</p>

<p>June, 1852, he is nominated by the Whig party for President.
He is opposed by President Fillmore and Secretary of
State Daniel Webster, who had been candidates. Is badly
defeated in the election by Franklin Pierce of the Democratic
party.</p>

<p>February, 1855, he is brevetted lieutenant-general from
date of March 29, 1847—the surrender of Vera Cruz. This
rank had not been in use since the death of Lieutenant-General
George Washington, and was now revived by
special act of Congress.</p>

<p>In November, 1859, he sails in the steamer <i>Star of the
West</i> for Puget Sound, by way of Panama, to adjust difficulties
arising between Great Britain and the United States
over the possession of San Juan Island of the international
boundary.</p>

<p>In 1860 he counsels the Government to garrison the forts
and arsenals on the Southern seaboard with loyal troops, and
thus probably prevent the threatened secession of the Southern
States. His advice is disregarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>In March, 1861, submits other plans by which he still
hopes that the rebellion may be averted.</p>

<p>Is offered high command by his native State, Virginia, and
declines to forsake the Flag.</p>

<p>October 31, 1861, being seventy-five years of age and long
a cripple, almost unable to walk from wounds and illness, he
retires from the army. President Lincoln and the cabinet call
upon him together and bid him farewell. There are tears in
the old hero’s eyes.</p>

<p>November, 1861, he sails for a visit in Europe.</p>

<p>December, 1861, is recommended by President Lincoln
in first annual message to Congress for further honors,
if possible.</p>

<p>June 10, 1862, his wife dies, leaving him with three daughters,
now grown.</p>

<p>He removes from New York to West Point, and on June 5,
1864, after a year’s work he completes his autobiography
in two volumes.</p>

<p>He dies at West Point, May 29, 1866, aged eighty, lacking
two weeks.</p>

<p class="noi title">INTO MEXICO WITH<br />
GENERAL SCOTT</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br />
<small>THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“The North Americans! They are getting
ready to attack the city!”</p>

<p>“Who says so? Where are they?”</p>

<p>“At Point Anton Lizardo, only sixteen miles
down the coast. A great fleet of ships has arrived
there, from North America. The sails looked like
a cloud coming over the ocean. The harbor is
crowded with masts and flags. Yes, they are getting
ready.”</p>

<p>That was the word which spread through old
Vera Cruz on the eastern coast of Mexico, at the
close of the first week of March, 1847.</p>

<p>“Well, the castle will sink them all with cannon
balls. It will be another victory. We shall see a
fine sight, like on a fiesta (holiday). Viva!”</p>

<p>“Bien! Viva, viva!” Or: “Good! Hurrah,
hurrah!”</p>

<p>There was excitement, but the news travelled
much faster than the Americans, for they seemed to
be still staying at desolate Anton Lizardo.</p>

<p>Now, March 9, up here at the city of Vera Cruz,
was as fine a day as anybody might wish for. The
sun had risen bright and clear above the Gulf of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Mexico, and one could see land and ocean for miles
and miles.</p>

<p>From the sand dunes along the beach about three
miles southeast of Vera Cruz, where Jerry Cameron
was helping old Manuel and young Manuel cut
brush for fagots, the view was pleasant indeed. To
the northward, up the sandy coast, the fine city of
Vera Cruz—the City of the True Cross—surrounded
by its fortified wall two miles in length, fairly shone
in the sunlight. Its white-plastered buildings and
the gilded domes of its many churches were a-glitter.
In the far distance, inland behind the city, the mountain
ranges up-stood, more than ten thousand feet
high, with Orizaba Peak glimmering snowy, and
the square top of Perote Peak (one hundred miles
west) deeply blue, in shape of a chest or strong-box.
Outside the sea-wall in front of the city there was the
sparkling bay, dotted with the sails of fishing boats,
and broken by shoals.</p>

<p>Upon a rocky island about a third of a mile out
from the city there loomed the darkly frowning
Castle of San Juan de Ulloa—the fort which guarded
the channel into the harbor. And almost directly
opposite the place where Jerry worked as a woodcutter
there basked the island of Sacrificios or Sacrifices,
about two miles out, with the flags of the
foreign men-of-war anchored near it streaming in
the breeze. While farther out, beyond Sacrificios,
appeared Green Island, where the ships of the United
States had been cruising back and forth, blockading
Vera Cruz itself.</p>

<p>The United States and Mexico were at war.
They had been at war for well-nigh a year, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
fighting was being done in the north, where the
Americans had tried to invade by crossing the Rio
Grande River and had been thrashed. At least,
those were the reports. General Antonio Lopez de
Santa Anna himself, Mexico’s famous leader, had
returned from exile in Cuba to command the army.
He had been landed at Vera Cruz without the Americans
objecting. The Americans had foolishly thought
that he would advise peace—or else they were afraid
to stop him. At any rate, he had gone on to Mexico
City, had gathered an army, and not a week ago word
had arrived that he had completely routed the army
of the American general named Taylor, in the battle
of Buena Vista, north Mexico!</p>

<p>It was said that the crack Eleventh Infantry of
the Mexican regular army had alone defeated the
North Americans. The Eleventh had marched to
war last summer, carrying their coats and shirts
and pantaloons slung on the ends of their muskets,
because the weather was hot. The soldiers had not
looked much like fighters, to Jerry; many of the
muskets were without locks, and most of the soldiers
were barefoot.</p>

<p>But the news of the great victory filled all Vera
Cruz with rejoicing. The guns of the forts were
fired, the church bells were rung, and the people
cheered in the streets, and from the sea-wall shook
their fists at the American fleet in the offing.</p>

<p>It had been unpleasant news to Jerry, he being
an American boy whose father had died in Vera
Cruz, from the yellow fever, and had left him alone.
He hated to believe that Mexico actually was whipping
the United States. But he and the few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
other Americans stranded here did not dare to
say anything.</p>

<p>Now that the North Americans (as they were
called) had been driven out, in the north, very likely
they would try to invade Mexico at another point.
Yes, no doubt they might be foolish enough to try
Vera Cruz, hoping to march even to the City of
Mexico from this direction! Of course, the notion
was absurd, for the City of Mexico was two hundred
and eighty miles by road, and on the other side
of the mountains. So the Vera Cruzans laughed
and bragged.</p>

<p>“No hay cuidado, no hay cuidado! Somos muy
valientes. Es una ciudad siempre heroica, esta Vera
Cruz de nosotros,” they said. Or, in other words;
“No fear, no fear! We are very brave. It is a city
always heroic, this Vera Cruz of ours.”</p>

<p>“That is right,” had agreed old Manuel and
young Manuel, with whom Jerry lived and worked.
“If those North Americans wish to come, let them
try. We have two hundred great guns on the walls,
and three hundred in the castle—some of them the
largest in the world. Yes, and five thousand soldiers,
and the brave General Morales to lead us.”</p>

<p>“The Vera Cruz walls are ten feet thick, and
those of the castle are fifteen feet thick,” old Manuel
added. “Cannon balls stick fast; that is all.”</p>

<p>“The guns will kill at two miles,” young Manuel
added. “Never once have those North American
ships dared to come within reach. The commander
at the castle laughs. He says to the American commander:
‘Bring on your fleet. You may fire all
your shot at us and we will not take the trouble
to reply. We only despise you.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“Así es—that is so,” grunted old Manual. “The
castle has stood there for two hundred and fifty years.
Please God, it will stand there two hundred and
fifty more years, for all that those Yahnkee savages
can do.”</p>

<p>It was true that the American fighting ships had
stayed far out from shore. They cruised back and
forth, preventing supplies from being brought in.
That was a blockade, but Vera Cruz did not care. It
had plenty to eat. It went about its business: the
fishing boats of the native Indians caught vast quantities
of fish in the harbor, the ranches raised cattle
and vegetables and fruits, and peons or laborers like
the two Manuels cut fagots and carried loads of it
on their burros into town, to sell as cooking fuel.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Jerry, who worked hard
with the two Manuels for his living, was out here
amidst the sand hills, as usual, on this bright morning
of March 9, 1847.</p>

<p>These sand hills fringed all the beach on both
sides of the city, and extended inland half a mile.
The winter gales or northers piled them up and
moved them about. Some of them were thirty feet
high—higher than the walls of the city. From their
crests one could look right into Vera Cruz. They
were grown between, and even to their tops, with
dense brush or chaparral, of cactus and thorny
shrubs, forming regular jungles; and there were
many stagnant lagoons that bred mosquitoes
and fevers.</p>

<p>From the city the National Road ran out, heading
westward for the City of Mexico, those two hundred
and eighty miles by horse and foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>To-day, of all the flags flying off shore scarcely
one was the American flag. The American warships
had disappeared entirely, unless that sloop tacking
back and forth several miles out might be American.
At first it had been thought that the Yankees had
grown discouraged by the news of the defeats of their
armies on land, and now did not know what to do.
The very sight of the grim castle of San Juan de
Ulloa had made them sick at their stomachs, the
Vera Cruzans declared. But the reports from Anton
Lizardo had changed matters.</p>

<p>The morning passed quietly, with the flags of the
city and castle—flags banded green, white and red
and bearing an eagle on a cactus in the center—floating
gaily, defying the unseen Americans. At
noon the two Manuels and Jerry ate their small lunch,
and drank water from a hole dug near a shallow
lagoon. Then, about two o’clock, old Manuel, who
had straightened up for a breath and to ease his
back, uttered a loud cry.</p>

<p>“Mira! See! The Americans are coming
again!”</p>

<p>He was gazing to the east, down the coast. Young
Manuel and Jerry gazed, squinting through the chaparral.
Out at sea, to the right of the little island
Sacrificios, there had appeared against the blue sky
a long column of ships, their sails shining whitely.
They came rapidly on, bending to the gentle breeze,
and swinging in directly for the island anchorage.
Scrambling like a monkey, old Manuel hustled for a
high, clear place and better view; young Manuel and
Jerry followed.</p>

<p>The foremost were ships of war; they looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
too trim and large, and kept in too good order, for
merchantmen, and they held their positions, in the
lead and on the flanks, as if guarding. But what
a tremendous fleet this was—sail after sail, until the
ships, including several steamers, numbered close to
one hundred! Soon the flags were plain: the red-and-white
striped flags of the United States, streaming
gallantly from the mast ends.</p>

<p>“The Americans!” young Manuel scoffed.
“They want another beating? They think to
frighten us Vera Cruzanos? Bah! We will show
them. We are ready. See?”</p>

<p>That was so. How quickly things had happened!
As if by a miracle the sea wall of Vera Cruz was alive
with people clustered atop; yes, and people were gathering
upon all the roofs, and even in the domes of
the churches. From this distance they were ants.
The news had spread very fast. The notes of the
army bugles sounded faintly, rallying the gunners
to the batteries.</p>

<p>Now out at the anchorage near Sacrificios the
mastheads and the yards of the foreign men of war
and the other vessels, from England, France, Spain,
Prussia, Germany, Italy, were heavy with sailors
clustered like bees, watching the approach of the
American fleet.</p>

<p>Straight for Sacrificios the fleet sped, silent and
beautiful, before a steady six-knot breeze which
barely ruffled the gulf. A tall frigate (the American
flagship <i>Raritan</i>) forged to the fore, and in its
wake there glided a vessel squat and bulky, leaving
a trail of black smoke.</p>

<p>“Un barco de vapor—a steamboat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes! But it has no paddles—it moves like
a snake!”</p>

<p>“No matter,” said old Manuel. “Everybody
knows that the North Americans are in league with
the Evil One. Only the Evil One could make a boat
to move without paddles. But the saints will protect
us.”</p>

<p>“They are bringing soldiers!” young Manuel
cried. “Look! The decks of the warships are
crowded!”</p>

<p>The American warships all forged to the fore;
in line behind the tall <i>Raritan</i> and the smoking new
steamer (which was only a propeller) they filed past
the foreign ships at the Sacrificios anchorage, and
about a mile from the beach they cast anchor also.
Now it might be seen that each ship had towed a line
of rowboats, and that every deck was indeed crowded
with soldiers, for muskets and bayonets flashed, uniforms
glittered, bands played, and a clatter and hum
drifted with the music to the shore.</p>

<p>The merchant ships stayed outside the anchorage,
as if waiting. There seemed to be seventy-five or
eighty of them; too many for the space inside.</p>

<p>The warships lost no time. Small launches instantly
began to tow the rowboats to their gangways;
soldiers began to descend——</p>

<p>“What! They are going to land here, on our
beach of Collado?” old Manuel gasped.</p>

<p>“No! Viva, viva!” young Manuel cheered.
“Our brave soldiers are there, waiting! Viva, viva!”</p>

<p>“Now we shall see!” And old Manuel cheered,
waving his ragged hat. “There will be a battle.
Maybe we shall have to run.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>From the brush and sand hills a troop of Mexican
lancers, in bright uniforms of red caps and red
jackets and yellow capes, had cantered down to the
open beach, their pennons flapping, their lance tips
gleaming. They rode and waved defiantly, daring
the Americans to come ashore.</p>

<p>A row of little flags broke out from the mizzen
mast of the <i>Raritan</i>. At once two gunboat steamers
and five sloops of war left the squadron, they
ploughed in, a puff of whitish smoke jetted from the
bows of a gunboat, and as quick as a wink another
puff burst close over the heads of the lancer troop.
Boom-boom!</p>

<p>The gay lancers, bending low in their saddles,
scudded like mad back into the sand hills and the
brush, with another shell peppering their heels.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” Jerry cheered, for it
looked as though that beach was going to be
kept clear.</p>

<p>He got such a box on the ear that it knocked him
sprawling and set his head to ringing.</p>

<p>“You shut up!” old Manuel scolded. “You
little American dog, you! Your Americans are cowards.
They dare not land and fight. They think
to stand off out at sea and fight. The miserable
gringos from the north! That’s the Mexican name
for them: gringos. You understand?”</p>

<p>No, Jerry did not understand. “Gringo” was
a new word—a contempt word recently invented by
the Mexicans, when they spoke of the North Americans—his
Americans. But he wasn’t caring, now;
he was wild with the box on the ear, and the sight of
the United States soldiers. Boxes on the ear never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
had angered him so, before. It was pretty hard to be
cuffed, here in front of the Flag; cuffed by the
enemies of the Flag.</p>

<p>“That isn’t so,” he snarled hotly. “They aren’t
cowards. You’ll see. They’ll land where they please.
<em><a href="#i_046">And all your army and guns can’t keep them off.</a></em>
Then they’ll walk right over your walls.”</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_46">“AND ALL YOUR ARMY AND GUNS CAN’T KEEP THEM OFF”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Shut up!” young Manuel bawled, and cuffed
him on the other side of the head. “Of course they
are cowards. They’ve been beaten many times by
our brave men. Your General Taylor has been captured.
He dressed like a woman and tried to hide.
Now your gringos are so afraid that they think to
land out of reach of our cannon. If they do land,
what will they do? Nothing. The minute they
come closer the guns of the castle will blow them
to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and soon the yellow fever will kill them.
They will find themselves in a death-trap,” old Manuel
added. “Bah! Our brave General Morales may
let them land. He sees how foolish they are. All
he needs do is to wait. Where can they go? Nowhere!
They will fight mosquitoes. That is it:
they are come to fight the mosquitoes!”</p>

<p>Jerry saw that there was no use in arguing; not
with two men whose hands were heavy, and who preferred
to believe lies. They did not know American
soldiers and sailors.</p>

<p>The cannon of the city and castle had not yet
spoken, but the walls of San Juan de Ulloa, like
those of Vera Cruz, a little nearer, were thronged
with people, watching. And that was a busy scene,
yonder toward Sacrificios. The two gunboats and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
five sloops cruised lazily only eight hundred yards
out from the beach, their guns trained upon it; the
sailors stood prepared at the pieces, and spy-glasses,
pointed at the beach, occasionally flashed with light.
Well it was, thought Jerry, that he and the two
Manuels were securely hidden. He did not wish an
American shot coming his way. But there, beyond
the seven patrol boats, the rowboats were being
loaded at the gangways of the men-of-war; for the
soldiers of his country evidently were determined
to land.</p>

<p>Boat after boat, crammed to the gunwales with
men, left the gangways, was pulled a short distance
clear, and lay to.</p>

<p>“How many boats?” young Manuel uttered.
“Many, many. It is wonderful.”</p>

<p>“And a crazy idea,” old Manuel insisted, “to
land here where the ships cannot follow, right in
sight of Vera Cruz. But the more the better;
the yellow fever will have a feast, and so will
the vultures.”</p>

<p>The loading of the boats took two hours. The
sun was almost set when the last one appeared to have
been filled. No shot had been fired by the Mexican
batteries. Suddenly a great cheer rang from the
ships and the boats; yes, even from the English,
and French and Spanish ships. The boats had
started; they were coming in at last, and a brave spectacle
they made: a half-circle more than three-quarters
of a mile front, closing upon the beach, with
oars flashing and bayonets gleaming and the trappings
of the officers glinting, all in the crystal air
of sunset, upon the smooth sea. The breeze had died<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
down, as if it, too, were astonished; but above the
boats a myriad seagulls swerved and screamed.</p>

<p>Five, ten, twenty, forty, sixty, sixty-seven!
Sixty-seven surf-boats each holding seventy-five or
one hundred soldiers! Sixty-seven surf-boats, and
one man-of-war gig!</p>

<p>“Sainted Mary! Where did the Americans get
them all?” old Manuel gasped.</p>

<p>Jerry thrilled with pride. Hurrah! He was an
American boy, and those were American ships and
American boats, manned by American soldiers and
American sailors, under the American flag. He
shivered a little with fear, also; for when the guns
of the castle and the city began to throw their shells,
what would happen to those blue-coated men, helpless
upon the bare beach of Collado?</p>

<p>The music from the bands in the boats and upon
the ships sounded plainly. The bands were playing
“Yankee Doodle,” “Hail, Columbia!” and “The
Star-Spangled Banner.” Even the dip of the oars
from the sixty and more boats, pulled by sailors,
sounded like a tune of defiance, as the blades rose
and fell and the oar-shafts thumped in their sockets.</p>

<p>Splash, splash, chug, chug, all together in a
measured chant; and still the guns of the city and
castle were silent, biding their time.</p>

<p>Now it was a race between the boats, to see which
should land its men first. The sailors were straining
at the oars; the figures of the soldiers—their bristling
muskets, their cross-belts and cartridge boxes,
their haversacks—were clear; their officers might be
picked out, and also the naval officers, one in the stern
of each boat, urging the rowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>The gig beat. One hundred yards from the beach
it grounded. It scarcely had stopped when a fine, tall
officer leaped overboard into the water waist deep;
with his sword drawn and waved and pointed he
surged for the shore. He wore a uniform frock
coat, with a double row of buttons down the front
and with large gold epaulets on the shoulders. Upon
his head was a cocked hat; and as he gained the
shallows the gold braid of his trousers seams showed
between boots and skirts. He was of high rank,
then; perhaps a general—perhaps the general of the
whole army! And his face had dark side-whiskers.</p>

<p>Close behind him there hurried a soldier with
the flag. All the men, mainly officers, his staff, had
leaped overboard; and from the other boats, fast and
faster, the men were leaping, and surging in, and in,
holding their muskets and cartridge boxes high,
and cheering.</p>

<p>“Boom!” A cannon shot! Smoke floated from
the bastion fort of Santiago, in the nearest corner
of the city walls, three miles up the shore; but
the ball must have fallen short.</p>

<p>“Boom!” A great gun in San Juan castle,
three miles and a half, had tried. By the spurt of
sand this ball also was short.</p>

<p>“We’d better get out of here,” old Manuel
rapped. “To the city! Quick! The Americans are
surely landing. We don’t want to have our ears cut
off; and we don’t want to be blown up, either. The
guns are beginning; they are playing for the dance.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and you come, too, you little gringo,”
young Manuel exclaimed, grabbing Jerry by the arm.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
“We’ll not have you running to those other gringos
and telling them tales.”</p>

<p>Away scuttled old Manuel and young Manuel,
dragging Jerry and shoving him before them while
they followed narrow trails amidst the dunes and the
thick, thorny brush. Presently they all heard another
hearty shout from a thousand and more throats;
but it was not for them.</p>

<p>Pausing and looking back they saw the whole
broad beach blue with the American uniforms; flags
of blue and gold were fluttering—a detachment of
the soldiers had marched to the very top of one high
dune and had planted the Stars and Stripes. Already
some of the boats were racing out to the ships, for
more soldiers. The bands upon the shore were
playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” again.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, gringito (little gringo)!”</p>

<p>“You will sing another tune if you don’t take
care. There!” And Jerry received a third and
fourth cuff. “Your soldiers are cowards. They
land out of reach of the guns. And now maybe we
have lost our burro.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go back for it, then?” Jerry
demanded. “Why don’t your own soldiers march
out and stop the soldiers of my country?”</p>

<p>“Because we Mexicans are too wise. The
Americans never can get near the city. Why should
we waste any lives on them? Now you come
along, gringito.”</p>

<p>And Jerry had to go, wild with rage and hot
with hopes.</p>

<p>The balls from the city and castle were falling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
short; the patrol vessels and the soldiers and sailors
paid no attention to them; but from all the ranches
and fields and huts outside the city walls the people
were hastening in, for protection. This was another
sight: those men, women and children, carrying
bundles, and driving laden donkeys, and chattering,
threatening, bragging and laughing.</p>

<p>Hustling on, Jerry and the two Manuels joined
with the rest, crossing the open strip a half a mile
wide, bordering the walls, and pushing in through the
gate on this side, named the Gate of Mexico and commanded
by batteries.</p>

<p>Inside the city there were hubbub and excitement.
The broad paved streets of the down-town
among the two-story stone buildings were crowded
as on a feast day. Bugles were pealing, drums were
beating, soldiers in the bright blue and white of the
infantry and the red and green of the artillery were
marching hither thither, lancers in their red and
yellow clattered through, while the roof-tops and the
church belfries above swarmed with gazers.</p>

<p>Nobody showed much fear.</p>

<p>“Wait, until the cannon get the range.”</p>

<p>“Or until the northers bury the gringos in
the sand!”</p>

<p>“And then the vomito, the yellow fever! That is
our best weapon.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes. All we Vera Cruzanos need do
is to wait.”</p>

<p>The northers, as everybody should know, were
the terrific winds that blew in the winter and early
spring; they blew so fiercely, from the gulf and a
clear sky, that anyone lying for a few moments in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the sand would be covered up. Neither man nor
beast could face a norther, there in the open where
the sand drifted like snow.</p>

<p>And the vomito, or yellow fever! Ay de mi!
That was worse. It came in the spring as soon as
the northers ceased and stayed all summer. Some
days and nights it appeared like a yellow mist, rising
from the lagoons of the coast and spreading toward
the city; men and women and children died by the
hundreds, even in the city streets, so that the buzzards
feasted on the bodies. The City of the Dead:
this was the name for Vera Cruz during the vomito
season. Everyone who was able fled to the
higher country inland, and stayed there above the
vomito fog.</p>

<p>Until ten o’clock this night the American boats
landed the American soldiers; by token of the twinkling
lights and the distant shouts the beach was
occupied for a mile of length, and the bivouacs
extended back into the dunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br />
<small>A SURPRISE FOR VERA CRUZ</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Boom!”</p>

<p>It was such a tremendous explosion that it shook
the solid buildings of the city. It also brought Jerry
upon his feet, all standing, where he had been asleep
for the night in a vacant niche against a stone warehouse.
A great many of the people slept this night
in the open air, just where they chanced to be, so
that they might miss no excitement.</p>

<p>The explosion awakened them all. There was
a rush for good viewpoints; perhaps the battle had
begun. Right speedily Jerry had scrambled atop
the wall at a place between batteries, from which he
could see the harbor and the Americans’ beach eastward.
Nobody objected to him, here.</p>

<p>“Boom—<em>Boom!</em>” A double explosion well-nigh
knocked him backward. A cloud of black
smoke had spurted from the walls of San Juan de
Ulloa castle, a quarter of a mile before; but yonder
amidst the sand hills the louder “<em>Boom!</em>” had raised
a much greater, blacker smoke, where the shell
had burst.</p>

<p>The people upon the wall cheered.</p>

<p>“Viva, viva!”</p>

<p>“Now we shall see. San Juan is speaking with
his giants.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Paixhans,” said a Volunteer. “It is
the Paixhans that he is turning loose, to blow the
Yankees up. Viva!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>The Paixhan guns were large pieces that threw
shells in a line, instead of solid shot or high-sailing
bombs like the mortars.</p>

<p>“Boom!” from the castle; and in a moment,
“<em>Boom!</em>” from the thickets of the dunes. The
smoke jetted angrily; the people imagined that they
could see brush and trees and bodies flying through
the air; but just how much damage was being done
no one might say, because most of the American
army was out of sight, concealed in the wilderness
of the jungle.</p>

<p>General Morales, commanding the city and castle,
had issued a proclamation calling upon the soldiers
and citizens to rally for the defense. All this
day the American boats, large and small, plied back
and forth between the fleet and the shore, out of
range, bringing in horses and mules and cannon and
supplies; when the cannon had been landed, soldiers
and sailors fell to like ants and helped the long teams
drag them across the beach, into the sand hills. The
larger part of the army had been swallowed by the
chaparral; but now and again a column of blue-uniformed
men could be sighted, winding through a
cleared spot, as if gradually encircling the city on
the land side.</p>

<p>All day the city forts and outworks and the castle
pitched round-shot and shell into the dunes. There
were several little battles when the Mexican lancers
and infantry outposts met the American advance.
A number of wounded Mexican soldiers were carried
in; but the American flags kept coming on, bobbing
here and there, bound inland.</p>

<p>“To-morrow it will blow,” the weather prophets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
asserted, noting the yellow sunset. “A norther!
Then those gringos will wish they were somewhere
else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, about noon the next day (which had
dawned calm), far out at sea a sharp, vivid line of
white appeared, approaching rapidly.</p>

<p>“The norther! Hurrah! It is the norther!”</p>

<p>A norther never had been so welcomed before.
The shipping was frantically lowering sails and putting
out storm anchors. The war vessels at Sacrificios
were riding under bare poles. The line of
white reached them—they bowed to it, their masts
sweeping almost to the water. On it came, at prodigious
speed, in a front miles long. The white was
foam, whipped feathery by wind. Suddenly all the
shipping in the harbor was in a confusion of scud;
the few American small boats plying between war
vessels and beach were striving desperately, and see!
The dunes had been veiled in a cloud of yellow dust
driven by the gale.</p>

<p>The change was miraculous. So strong was the
wind that it cleaned the walls of people. Like the
rest, Jerry crouched in shelter, while the gale
howled overhead.</p>

<p>The dunes were completely shut from view by
the cloud of scud and sand. Firing from the city
and castle ceased. There was nothing to do but wait
and let the norther work. Somewhere under that
sand cloud the Americans crouched also, fighting for
breath and to keep from being buried. Here in Vera
Cruz everybody was safe and happy, except Jerry
Cameron. He was safe, but he was sorry for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
those other Americans, although he did not dare
to say so.</p>

<p>It was a bad norther. It blew without a pause
for two nights and days. Then, about noon of the
third day, which was March 13, it quit about as suddenly
as it had arrived. It left the ocean tossing
with white caps and thundering against the sea-wall
and upon the beach, but the air over the dunes cleared
and all eyes peered curiously to see what had become
of the American army.</p>

<p>Why, the flags were nearer! Some of them fluttered
at the very inside edge of the hills, not much
more than half a mile away, across the open space
which skirted the city walls. There were signs that
the ground was being dug out, as if for batteries.
As soon as the ocean quieted a little, the boats again
hustled back and forth, landing more guns and supplies.
The forts and castle fired furiously at the
American camps. But the Americans had not been
stopped by the norther and they were not to be
stopped by shot and shell.</p>

<p>Now more than a week passed in this kind of
business, with the city and castle firing, and with the
Mexican soldiers skirmishing in the brush to annoy
the gringos, and with the Americans doing little by
day, but each night creeping nearer. One morning
a strange new token was to be sighted. To the south
the ground had been upheaved, during the night, out
from the edge of the dunes, and a line of earth
extended like a mole-run into the cleared space.
The Americans were burrowing.</p>

<p>The city forts lustily bombarded the place and
evidently drove the Americans out of the trench, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
there was no reply. In fact, very few gringos were
seen, but their flags might be glimpsed, farther back.
Where were their cannon?</p>

<p>After this fresh burrows appeared frequently.
Still there was no firing by the American cannon.
What was being done, in that brush, none of the
Vera Cruzans could say from such a distance.
Only——</p>

<p>“It will be a siege,” the wise-acres nodded.
“Very well. We shall wait until the vomito comes.
The vomito will fight for us, in the sand hills where
our brave soldiers cannot go. The yellow fever will
find those skulking gringos, who dare not attack us.”</p>

<p>Then, about two o’clock of March 22, after the
Americans had been digging and dragging cannon
for almost two weeks, and had advanced their flags in
a complete half circle around the city, excitement
rose again. A Yankee officer and two other men,
bearing a white flag, had ridden out from among the
dunes and were boldly cantering forward across the
flat strip, for the southern Gate of Mexico.</p>

<p>The three were received by a Mexican officer sent
by General Morales. Word spread that the American
general, named Scott, demanded the surrender of
Vera Cruz! He gave two hours for an answer.</p>

<p>General Morales did not require the two hours.
Before the time was up, back went the flag of truce,
while the soldiers loudly cheered when they learned
that he had refused to surrender. If the Americans
wished to try a battle, let them start in; they all
would die without having reached the walls; and as
for breaching the walls with their cannon, that
was impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Four o’clock had been the limit set by the American
general, Scott. Usually Vera Cruz slept from
noon until four; all Mexico took its siesta then: stores
were closed and shutters drawn and nobody stirred
abroad; in Vera Cruz even the water carriers who
cried “Water! Pure water!” on the streets, dozed
like the rest. And by this time, two weeks, the
people had grown accustomed to the guns, so that
they slept right through.</p>

<p>But this afternoon the city waked early, and
by four o’clock the roof tops and the walls were
thick with spectators watching to see what would
happen. Ragged Jerry gazed with the others. He
had paid no attention to the two Manuels. There
had been no fagot gathering, and little other business
except talk.</p>

<p>The sea was smooth; the ships swung at anchor
under a blue sky; out at Sacrificios island, four miles
distant to the east, the Stars and Stripes languidly
flapped from the mast ends of the men-of-war;
the sand dunes shimmered yellow, buzzards circled
above them and the chaparral which flowed into the
flat strip—the buzzards might see the American
army, but few persons in the city could. Nevertheless,
from the east clear around into the west the
faint sounds of the burrowing blue coats drifted in.</p>

<p>There was no sign of any charge. Then, at four
o’clock precisely, from a spot half a mile out, between
the city and Collado Beach, a sudden great
belch of black smoke issued; a black speck streaked
high through the sky, fell—and there was a resounding
crash and a mighty shock, from an explosion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
in the very center of the city. The clatter
of stones followed.</p>

<p>Next, while the people gazed at each other,
astounded, in the southeast the chaparral was
drowned by a perfect torrent of the same smoke,
blasts of air rocked the very walls and buildings, all
the city shook to explosion after explosion mingled.
Several shells had arrived at once; the air was filled
with dust and shrieks.</p>

<p>Vera Cruz was being bombarded. The bastion
guns boomed hotly, replying; the great guns of the
castle chimed in; the chaparral was being torn to
pieces. But so was the city; and out in the roadstead
the two steam gunboats and the five sloops of
war veered nearer and from a mile away began to
shoot, also, at the city and the castle both.</p>

<p>The battle had opened. The Americans were
firing only seven mortars; that was all—seven.
Where were their other cannon? Stuck in the sand
and brush, as like as not. The seven mortars were
hard to see, but the city forts and the castle would
bury them. As for those little ships a mile at sea,
one shot from San Ulloa would sink any of them.</p>

<p>However, the mortars stuck to it. They kept
firing all night, while it was too dark for the forts
and the castle to answer. There was no sleep for
Vera Cruz—not amidst that steady “Boom! Boom!
Boom!” and “Crash! Crash! Crash!”, with
showers of iron and rock flying far and wide into
all parts of the city.</p>

<p>In the morning ten mortars were at work. The
forts and San Ulloa spouted smoke and flame in vain.
The walls had not been hurt; but what with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
booming, and the crashing, and the yelling and running,
assuredly Vera Cruz was no place in which to
stay. Jerry resolved to get out before he, an American
boy, was killed by shots from his own country.</p>

<p>This afternoon another norther set in, as if to
help Vera Cruz. It silenced the mortars, and drove
the American gunners to cover. Nobody could see
to shoot in such a dust storm. The people were
happy over it. They knew that the northers and
the yellow fever would come to their rescue. The
Americans were crazy, their guns useless, their
trenches would be filled faster than they could be
dug. But to Jerry the norther looked like a lucky
stroke for one American, at least. To slip over the
walls and sneak across the flat strip and enter the
American camp would be as easy as—well, as cutting
a watermelon.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br />
<small>THE AMERICANS GAIN A RECRUIT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The norther was making things uncomfortable
in the city as well as outside. The streets were
lashed by howling wind, and raked by sand and bits
of clay; loosened stones crashed to the pavement,
threatening the few people who scuttled around the
corners; and when the thick dusk gathered early Vera
Cruz seemed deserted. But if matters were bad here,
what must they be yonder, out in the open?</p>

<p>Jerry was going to know, pretty soon. It was
time that he left Vera Cruz. He did not belong in
Vera Cruz, where Americans were disliked. It was
the enemy’s country. The two Manuels had housed
him in their shack, and had fed him, but only because
he worked for them. He had not seen them
this day—did not wish ever to see them again; they
had cuffed him on the ears, they thought little of
slapping him about. He had stayed with them because
there was nothing else for him to do. But
now his own people had arrived to teach these Mexicans
a lesson; had brought the Flag right to the doorway
of Mexico, and were knocking for admittance.</p>

<p>If they really did not get in—of course they
would get in, but supposing they didn’t, and had to
go away and try at another place! Supposing, as the
Vera Cruzans said, the walls held out against the
cannon, and the yellow fever raged, then he would
be stranded the same as before. It was a long, long
way from Vera Cruz to the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>So this was the time to make a dash for freedom,
while the way was short and the norther blew.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the darkness was dense with the
smother of dust. Nobody saw him as he ran low
like a rabbit, tacking from building to building and
corner to corner, until he had reached the wall at a
place nearest to the American cannon. The wall
was twelve feet high, here; at intervals it was built
into batteries, jutting outside and inside both;
but to-night even the sentries had been forced
under cover.</p>

<p>The wall was very old; there were sections where
it had crumbled and could be climbed easily enough
by means of toe-holds and finger-holds. All the boys
of Vera Cruz knew that old wall perfectly; and it
was used as a promenade also by men and women
who strolled upon the wide top.</p>

<p>The American cannon had done little damage to
it yet. The mortar bombs all passed over, to land
in the city. But Jerry remembered a spot where he
often had climbed before, in fun—and to show the
Vera Cruzans that their wall could not keep a boy in.</p>

<p>He had to guess at the spot, in the wind and the
darkness. When he thought that he was there, he
shinned up. Here the wind struck him full blast, and
whew! He had to lie flat and crawl, clutching fast
with fingers and toes, feeling his way, and fairly
plastered to the rough top. If once he raised up,
away he would go like a leaf; for that wind certainly
meant business.</p>

<p>At last, feeling ahead, he came to the crumbled
edge. And now, cautiously swinging about, he prepared
to slide over feet first. If this was the right
spot, he would land outside after a slide of only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
about ten feet. But how to tell? There wasn’t any
way. It might be that this was not the right place
at all, and he would drop straight down more than
ten feet and break a leg. Still, he was bound to try.
So he backed like a crab, farther and farther, exploring
with his toes; he was over the edge, he was clinging
with his knees and hands and barking his shins—and
on a sudden the edge gave under his fingers and
down he slithered, fast and faster, all in the darkness,
with clatter and rasp and scrape, until—thump!</p>

<p>No, it had not been the exact spot. Maybe by
daylight he wouldn’t have risked such a long slide,
on his stomach. But his clothes could not be hurt—a
few more rags made no difference, and he was
all right.</p>

<p>He had landed on his back in the dry moat or ditch
which skirted the bottom of the wall. Under his feet
there was a heap of mortar from the wall, and a
stiff bush had almost skewered him. He picked himself
up, to claw out. In a moment the wind struck
him full, again—sent him reeling and sprawling, and
stung his cheek with sand and pebbles. Somewhere
before him there lay the dunes and the American
camp; but he could not see a thing, he had to
cross the flat, brushy strip half a mile wide, and
unless he kept his wits sharpened he would get
all turned around.</p>

<p>Well, the wind was his only guide; it hit him
quartering, from the left or gulf side—came like a
sheet of half-solid air, to flatten him. Leaning
against it he bored on, trying to go in a straight line.
Ouch! Cactus! And more cactus. Ouch! A large
thorny bush. Ouch! A hollow into which he stepped
with a grunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>The plain was a whirlpool of whistling wind and
blinding sand that took his breath and blistered his
cheek. The cactus stabbed him, the brush tripped
him; every little while he had to sit down and rest.
One lone boy seemed a small figure in the midst of
that great storm, black with murk, especially when
he wasn’t dead certain that he was heading right.</p>

<p>That was a tremendously long half mile. Was
he never going to get to the other edge? Perhaps he
would be better off if he stayed in one spot and
waited for morning. No; then he would be caught
between two fires—might be shot by one side or the
other, or else captured by prowling Mexican soldiers.</p>

<p>After a while the wind slackened a little; the air
cleared, and so did the sky. A moon peeped forth
from the overhead scud. He thought that he could
see the dunes, in a dim line, and he pushed on for
them as fast as he could. He ought to be drawing
near to them, by this time, for Vera Cruz lay hours
behind him, according to the way his legs ached from
his stumblings and zigzaggings.</p>

<p>Here came the wind, again—in a terrific blast as
if it had been only taking breath, too. The moon
vanished, everything vanished, and he was blinded
by the dust once more.</p>

<p>Then, quite unexpectedly, as he was leaning and
gasping and blundering on, breaking through the
brush and never minding the cactus, he ran against
a mound of sand. He sort of crawled up this, clawing
his way—the wind seized him, on top, hurled him
forward, and down he pitched, headfirst, into a hole
on the other side.</p>

<p>This time he landed upon something soft and
alive. It grabbed him tightly in two arms and he
heard a voice in good sailor American:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“Shiver my timbers! Belay there, whoever you
be. Hey, maties! Stand by to repel boarders!
They’re entering by the ports.”</p>

<p>“No, no! I’m a boy—I’m an American!” Jerry
panted. “There’s nobody else.”</p>

<p>“A boy? Bless my bloomin’ eyes.” The grip
relaxed, but the voice growled. “Wot d’you foul my
hawser for, when I’m snugged under for the night,
with storm anchors out?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” Jerry stammered.</p>

<p>“Who are you, then? Wot’s your rating? Answer
quick, and no guff.”</p>

<p>“I’m nobody ’special—I’m Jerry Cameron. I’ve
run away from Vera Cruz.”</p>

<p>“Under bare poles, too, by the feel of you.
You’re a bloody spy, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” Jerry implored. “I’m an American,
I told you.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the rest of your boarding crew?”</p>

<p>“There aren’t any.”</p>

<p>“Does your mother know you’re out?”</p>

<p>“She’s dead. So’s my father.”</p>

<p>“Now if you’re one o’ them young limbs o’
drummer boys, playing a game on me——”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” Jerry declared.</p>

<p>“Wot do you want here?”</p>

<p>“I want to join the army.”</p>

<p>“The army! Get out, then. Don’t you go taking
this for any landlubber mess. Avast with you!
Port your helm and sheer off.” And the
clutch loosened.</p>

<p>“But where am I, please?” Jerry asked,
bewildered.</p>

<p>“Wait till I put a half hitch on you and I’ll tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
you; for if you’re putting up a game you’ll be
hanged to the yardarm at sunrise. That’s regulations.
Lie quiet, now. I’m hungry and I’m a reg’lar
bloomin’ cannerbal.”</p>

<p>A cord was deftly passed about Jerry’s slim waist,
tightened, tied, and apparently fastened to his captor
also—who growled again as if satisfied. Flint and
steel were struck, and a lantern lighted—a lantern
enclosed in a wire netting—a battle lantern. It was
flashed upon Jerry, and at the same time flashed upon
his captor. He saw a very red face—a dirty face but
a good-natured face, under a shock of tow hair; and
a pair of broad shoulders encased in a heavy woollen
jacket. Two bright blue eyes surveyed him.</p>

<p>“A bloomin’ bloody stowaway,” the man
growled, not unkindly. “That’s wot! Well, wot
you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Where am I, if this isn’t the army?” Jerry
pleaded.</p>

<p>“The army be blowed,” answered the man.
“This is the navy, young feller. Bless my eye, but
you’re in the naval battery, as you’ll soon find out,
and so’ll those bloody dons when we open up in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But I think I’d like to stay, anyway,”
said Jerry; for he was down under the wind,
and he was very tired.</p>

<p>“Right-o, my hearty.” The man untied the rope.
“Now we can lie yard and yard, but mind you keep
quiet, ’cause I’m dead for sleep. One wiggle, and
out you go. All quiet below decks. That’s discipline
and them’s man-o’-war orders.”</p>

<p>The sailor turned down the lantern, and settled
himself with a grunt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br />
<small>JERRY MAKES A TOUR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The norther certainly was slackening off, as if it
had blown itself out. The wind died to a fitful
breeze, and this itself finally ceased. There was a
dead calm. Overhead the stars sparkled again. It
seemed to be a great relief to everything—this calm,
after the lashing and the howling and the general
strain. Only the gulf surf roared dully in
the distance.</p>

<p>Now voices sounded, right and left and behind,
as if the American camp had aroused and the men
were issuing from their coverts. They had weathered
the storm. Jerry carefully raised, to look.
He could see the occasional flash of a lantern. Then
he lay down. In the calm he was more exhausted
than ever. That had been a tough trail through the
brush, fighting the wind at every step. Before he
knew, he was asleep, beside the snoring sailor; and
the next that he knew, he was awakened into gray
dawn by a bustle around him.</p>

<p>Where was he? Oh, yes; he was safe with the
Americans. So he got up, shook himself, and
took stock.</p>

<p>He was still out in the plain, instead of at the
edge of the dunes; the trench which sheltered him
was six feet wide and the same in depth, and was
screened by brush outside the dirt thrown out. It
ran right and left, as if connecting with other
trenches. Figures of sailors and their officers hurried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
back and forth, scarcely noticing him. There
were gruff orders. He had to see what was going
on; so he fell in with the busy files, and in a moment
he had arrived at the breech of an enormous cannon,
surrounded by sailors stripped to the waist and tugging
and heaving to move the cannon into place.</p>

<p>Beyond it there was another cannon, already in
place, its muzzle pointing out through sandbags, its
squatty solid iron frame resting upon little wheels
which fitted a pair of iron rails bolted to a plank
turn-table upon a platform. Beyond that was still
another great gun. And to the rear there was the
sand-bagged roof of a low hut, sunk deeply almost
on the level with the surface of the ground. This
was a battery, then; and that probably was the
powder house—the magazine. And all had been
dug out, and erected, here, between the dunes and
Vera Cruz, in point-blank range of the walls!</p>

<p>By the hurry and bustle something was going to
happen very soon. A smart naval officer in blue and
gold, with sword drawn, was overseeing the work
of setting the first gun into position. A boatswain,
his shirt open upon his hairy chest and a whistle
dangling at the end of a cord, was bossing. Everybody
was a sailor, so it must be the naval battery.</p>

<p>The boatswain saw Jerry staring; and he stared
likewise.</p>

<p>“Hi! What you doin’ here, young ’un?”</p>

<p>“Just watching,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Where you from?”</p>

<p>“Vera Cruz. But I’m an American.”</p>

<p>“Shiver my tops’ls!” uttered the boatswain;
and the other sailors briefly paused to wipe their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
brows and grin. “A bloomin’ American from Very
Cruz.” He saluted the officer. “Recruit for the
navy, sir. What shall I do with him?”</p>

<p>“Send him to the rear. This is no place for
boys,” rapped the officer. “What’s your name, lad?”</p>

<p>“Jerry Cameron.”</p>

<p>“How did you get in here?”</p>

<p>“I ran away from Vera Cruz last night. I don’t
belong there.”</p>

<p>“Too much Yankee music in that city, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It’s awful.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will be worse. If you’ve come to join
the band you’ll have to go to the rear. We can’t
take care of you here. Things will open lively in a
short time, now.”</p>

<p>And as if to prove his words the air shook, a dull
boom sounded, a louder boom rolled from the dunes.
Vera Cruz had awakened to action again.</p>

<p>“You follow that trench and keep going,” the
officer ordered. “March, before your head’s
blown off.”</p>

<p>“Boom—<em>Bang!</em>” A great mass of sand and
brush spouted up not fifty yards to the front, and
the shock sent everyone staggering. A shell from
Vera Cruz had landed near indeed. “Boom—<em>Bang!</em>”
That was another. The Mexican batteries
were trying.</p>

<p>“Handspikes, there! Put a block under that
transom, bo’s’n,” barked the officer, never noticing.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” The men jumped to their work.
Jerry turned and headed back through the trench.
He was glad that he was not to be in Vera Cruz
this day. Those guns looked mean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>The trench, higher than his crown and wider than
he was tall, led obliquely toward the dunes. To
have cut such a trench must have been a prodigious
job—and the queer part was, that from Vera Cruz
the work had not been seen.</p>

<p>Judging by deep wheel tracks the cannon had
been dragged through the trench, to the front.</p>

<p>For a little way he met nobody. Now the shells
from the city and castle were bursting all around
him, well-nigh deafening him; and from a distance
the American guns were replying. Next, he came
to a squad of sailors, sitting in a side gallery and
eating breakfast. They hailed him.</p>

<p>“Ahoy! Where bound, young ’un?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere,” Jerry answered.</p>

<p>“Heave to, then, and come aboard with your
papers. Where you from?”</p>

<p>“Vera Cruz.”</p>

<p>“Lay alongside.” So Jerry turned in. “What’s
your colors? Speak sharp. Report to the admiral.”</p>

<p>“Red, white and blue,” asserted Jerry.</p>

<p>“Blow me, but he is American, by the cut of his
jib,” one of them exclaimed. “Where’s your convoy,
young sloop-o’-war?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere. I ran away last night.”</p>

<p>“Homeward bound in ballast. Can’t you see he’s
floating clean above loading mark?” said another.
“He’s empty to his keel. Fall to, my hearty. Line
your lockers.”</p>

<p>They were a jovial party, grimy with sand and
sweat, their blue sailor shirts open, their faces red and
their big hands tarry and scarred. They passed
him hard biscuit and meat and a cup of coffee—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
every now and again the earth shook to the explosion
of a shell. While they were asking him questions
about himself, and Vera Cruz, and the Mexicans (for
whom they appeared to feel much scorn) there was a
fresh hullaballoo, somewhere in the main trench.
Up they sprang, to crowd and gaze.</p>

<p>“Another pill-tosser to feed the bloomin’ dons,”
they cried. “Hooray!”</p>

<p>And here, through the trench, there came one of
the great naval guns: first, rounding an elbow, a
long double file of sailors, stripped to the waist,
leaning low to a rope and tugging like horses; then
the breech of the gun, then high wheels upon which
it had been mounted, with other sailors wrestling at
them; then the immensely long barrel, with still other
sailors pushing at this clear to the muzzle.</p>

<p>A bo’s’n trudged beside, urging the work. When
the gun stuck for a moment crowbars were thrust
under the wheels—</p>

<p>“Heave-ho! Together, now! Heave-ho!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye! Heave-ho!”</p>

<p>“Heave, my bullies!”</p>

<p>And they panted a song:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Way down Rio, Rio, Rio!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">’Way down Rio, Oh!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The gun went surging by.</p>

<p>“We’ll be needed up for’d, maties,” said one
of the sailor squad. “Young ’un, you set your
course the direction you were steering.”</p>

<p>They mopped their mouths with the backs of their
tarry fists and lurched on after the cannon.</p>

<p>Jerry proceeded. Next, but not much farther,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the trench was cut by another trench, crossing it at
right angle and extending without end on either hand.
This trench on right and left was lined with blue-capped,
blue-coated soldiers, crouching low, or daringly
peering through openings they had made in the
ridge of sand thrown out in front of the trench, their
long-barreled muskets leaning against the wall, beside
them. Jerry kept on, following the wheel tracks.</p>

<p>His trench grew shallow; and the wheel tracks
wound through low places amidst the dunes. He
left the trench behind him. Next, he began to see
soldiers in squads—messing, shaking their blankets
free of sand, clearing out small trenches that had
almost filled during the storm; and so forth and so
forth. And tents, some blown flat and being hoisted
again; and the United States flags, and regimental
flags; and stacks of muskets in rows.</p>

<p>The soldiers appeared to be of the rough-and-ready
order; many of them bearded or stubbly, their
uniforms worn carelessly, their caps set at an angle;
some were barefoot, as if easing their feet; some had
on shoes, and some had one trouser-leg tucked into a
boot-top; and several who seemed ill were sitting enveloped
in Mexican blankets.</p>

<p>They were singing—these soldiers—in groups,
as they lolled or worked at various tasks; singing not
very musically, but gaily:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent3">“Green grow the rushes, O!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Green grow the rushes, O!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sweetest hours that e’er I spend</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Are spent among the lasses, O!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>That was the chorus of one group nearest to
Jerry, as he sidled through the camp. It was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
much of a song, although as good as most of the
Mexican songs. He saw a flag, of blue and gold,
which said “First Tennessee Volunteers.” A soldier
was shaking it out from its folds.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m in the army, anyway,” Jerry thought,
to himself. “But I guess I’ll go on, to the beach, and
see what’s there.”</p>

<p>So although the men hailed him, as the sailors
had, only in different language, he shook his head
and did not stop.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he came to a cleaner camp, within
easy sight of the surf beyond the dunes, and of the
ships at anchor off Sacrificios. There were many
soldiers, here, too, but more orderly and better
clothed. The camp appeared to stretch clear to
the beach; and while he was wandering and gazing,
somebody challenged him.</p>

<p>It was another boy, in uniform—a red-headed
boy, spick and span and as smart as a new whip.</p>

<p>“Hey, you! What you doing?”</p>

<p>He wore a tight blue jacket and lighter blue
trousers; the front of the jacket was crossed by a
lot of red braid, a high collar held his chin up, upon
his head was perched a jaunty blue, red-decorated
round cap with leather visor, and a short sword hung
at his right thigh.</p>

<p>“Nothing special,” Jerry answered back.</p>

<p>“Come over till I investigate. We don’t allow
camp followers in the lines.”</p>

<p>Jerry went over.</p>

<p>“I’m not a camp follower,” he retorted. The
soldiers who heard, laughed.</p>

<p>“Then what’s your regiment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>“Haven’t any, yet. I left Vera Cruz only
last night.”</p>

<p>“You did! Huh! That’s a likely yarn. How’d
you get into the lines, then?”</p>

<p>“Just walked. I skipped out, over the wall, and
crossed the plain in the storm.”</p>

<p>“What’d you skip out for?”</p>

<p>“Because I’m an American. I don’t like it in
Vera Cruz.”</p>

<p>“Guess you didn’t. Guess nobody does—and
they’ll all like it less, to-day. We’re to give ’em
a jolly good shaking up. Got any folks?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Anybody come with you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Jerry Cameron.”</p>

<p>“That sounds all right. What did you do in
Vera Cruz?”</p>

<p>“Lived there with my father until he died from
yellow fever. Then I worked for two Mexicans,
until I had a chance to run away.”</p>

<p>“Mind you don’t lie.”</p>

<p>“I’m not lying. Should think you could see
I’m American.”</p>

<p>“Guess you are. Guess you’re O. K., Jerry.
I’m Hannibal Moss, drummer boy, Company A,
Eighth United States Infantry,” said the boy, with a
little swagger of importance. “That’s what. Best
company in the best fighting regiment of the whole
army. What you intend to do? Join us?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to, mighty well.”</p>

<p>“Where’ve you been since you got in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“Out there with the sailors and the big guns.
That’s where I landed. But they sent me back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the navy battery. What’d you think
of it?”</p>

<p>“They’re the biggest guns I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Guess they are. Guess they’ll fix those dons—blow
their walls to pieces. They’re sixty-eight-pounder
shell guns and thirty-two-pounder solid shot
fellows. You bet! The army’s got some just as
big, but they haven’t come yet, so the navy’s going
to help us out. We’ve a battery of twenty-four-pounders
out there, though. Only seven hundred
yards from the walls. Wait till you hear the music.”</p>

<p>“The walls haven’t been hurt yet; or they hadn’t
been, when I left,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s because we weren’t ready. We’ve had
to use mortars; but throwing bombs into houses isn’t
what we’re here for. Old Fuss and Feathers—he
knows what he’s about. That’s why he called on the
navy, when his own siege guns didn’t arrive. He
wants to finish things here and march on into the
mountains before the yellow fever starts up. Say,
it’s been pretty hot in Vera Cruz, hasn’t it, with all
those bombs bursting?”</p>

<p>“It certainly has,” Jerry answered soberly.
“They’ve killed people who weren’t fighting, and
knocked down a lot of houses.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s war. The Mexicans ought to have
surrendered when they had a chance. They can
surrender any time. All they need do is to hang out
a white flag. Fuss and Feathers is going to take their
city. He doesn’t want their houses, though, and I
guess he’s sorry to hurt non-combatants. The civilians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
ought to have moved their families out. After
we’ve breached the walls proper and forced terms,
we’ll have Vera Cruz as a base and we’ll march
straight to the Halls of Montezuma.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Fuss and Feathers?”</p>

<p>Hannibal stared.</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything about the army, that’s
sure. Fuss and Feathers is Major-General Winfield
Scott, commander-in-chief of the United States
army. We call him Fuss and Feathers, for fun. Not
when he’s around, though. M-m-m! You bet not!
He’s a stickler for discipline. But he’ll take us to the
Halls of Montezuma.”</p>

<p>“Where are they, Hannibal!”</p>

<p>“My eye, you’re green! The Halls of Montezuma
are the capitol in the City of Mexico, of course.
Guess you’ve a lot to learn. Want me to show you
about? Maybe I can find you a job if you’re an
American. Looks like you need a suit of clothes—but
you aren’t much worse than some of those Mohawks
are already. Come on; let’s walk.”</p>

<p>“You see, I’m off duty,” Hannibal explained, as
he strolled with Jerry in tow. “We had to work
half the night, digging trenches. We just got back.
Golly, but that was a storm, wasn’t it! Filled us up
as fast as we could dig out. But no storms are
going to stop this army. Say; do you know where
you are?”</p>

<p>“In the American army.”</p>

<p>“Yes, siree, and in the First Division, too. This
is Brigadier-General William J. Worth’s division of
Regulars: Fourth Infantry, Fifth Infantry, Sixth
Infantry, Eighth Infantry, Second and Third Artillery.
The Eighth Infantry—that’s my regiment—is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
in the Second Brigade. Colonel Clarke’s our commander.
Garland’s commander of the First Brigade.
They’re both good men—and so’s General
Worth. My eye! Isn’t he, though! You’re lucky
to have struck the Regulars. If you’d stayed with
the Mohawks—my eye!”</p>

<p>“Who are they, Hannibal?”</p>

<p>“The Volunteers. We call ’em ‘Mohawks’ because
they’re so wild. They’re General Patterson’s
division, the Third: the Palmettos—those are the
South Carolinans; the First and Second Tennessee
Mountaineers; the First and Second Pennsylvania
Keystoners; the Second New Yorkers; the Third and
Fourth Illinois Suckers; the Georgia Crackers, and
the Alabamans. Guess they can fight, but they’re
awful on discipline. Won’t even salute their officers.
Expect you passed through them on your way
from the naval battery.”</p>

<p>The sun had risen, flooding all the chaparral and
glinting on the gulf surges beyond the fringing beach.
The uproar of the cannon in castle and city had
welled to a deep, angry chorus; the American guns
were answering; the morning air quivered to the
quick explosions; and over city and strip of plain a
cloud of black smoke floated higher and higher,
veiling the sun itself. Now and then a piece of shell
droned in, skimming the sand hills and kicking
up puffs of dust. A round-shot of solid iron actually
came rolling down a slope and landed at their very
feet. Jerry stooped to feel of it. Ouch! It was
still hot.</p>

<p>“Shucks!” Hannibal laughed. “Put it in your
pocket.” He cocked his cap defiantly. “It’s a dead
one. When you’re in your first battle you think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
every gun is aimed at you; and after that you
don’t care.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been in other battles, Hannibal?”</p>

<p>“I should rather say! We’re all veterans, in this
division. We were with Old Zach—he’s General
Zachary Taylor—when he licked the dons at Palo
Alto and Resaca de la Palma in Texas last May,
and we helped take Monterey in September. We’d
have been licking ’em again if we hadn’t been sent
here with Old Fuss and Feathers.”</p>

<p>“But General Taylor’s been licked since, hasn’t
he? At Buena Vista?”</p>

<p>“He? Old Zach? Do you believe that story?
It’s just a Mexican lie. I wasn’t there, but the New
Orleans papers say he wasn’t licked at all. There
can’t anybody lick Old Zach. He just wears his old
clothes and sits his horse sideways, and tells the men:
‘The bayonet, my hardy cocks!’ When we joined
Old Fuss and Feathers we knew he was all right,
too, but we expected to have to dress up and shave.
I tell you, there was hustling. Regulations say that
officers’ and men’s hair has got to be cropped—cut
short, you know; whiskers can’t grow lower than
the ears and nobody except the cavalry can wear
moustaches. Old Davy—that’s General David
Twiggs of the Second Division of Regulars—he had
a white beard reaching nearly to his waist, and he
shaved it all off and cut his hair. Looked funny, too.
But the regulations aren’t being enforced, after all.
We’re in Mexico to fight. Wait till you see General
Worth’s side-whiskers. But let’s climb a hill, farther
front, and lie down, and I’ll show you things. No!
Wait a minute. Listen to that cheering. I guess
there’s news. Come on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>They ran back, toward the camp. Cheers could
be heard—beginning at the beach edge of the dunes
and traveling inward. The soldiers were running,
and gathering. An officer on horseback attended by
other mounted officers was riding slowly on, among
the dunes and occasionally stopping. Whenever he
had paused, fresh cheers arose.</p>

<p>“That’s General Worth, and Captain Mackall,
division adjutant,” Hannibal informed. “Golly!
Wonder what’s up. Something special.”</p>

<p>They hastened until they had joined a crowd of
the men, all waiting expectant, for General Worth
and party were coming on.</p>

<p>“Mind your eye, now,” Hannibal whispered.
“If you know how to salute you’d better do it.
You’re with the Regulars.”</p>

<p>The soldiers stiffened to attention—Hannibal
like the rest, and Jerry trying to imitate. Every
hand went to a salute. General Worth was as fine
a looking man as one might ever see—tall and straight
in the saddle, with handsome face, dark complexion,
flashing black eyes, and side-whiskers of graying
black. Rode perfectly.</p>

<p>He halted again, returning the salute.</p>

<p>“By direction of General Scott you will listen
to good news, men,” he said.</p>

<p>Whereupon another officer, who evidently was the
division adjutant, unfolded a paper, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The commanding general of the Army of Invasion
takes prompt occasion to announce to his
fellow soldiers that by battle of February Twenty-second
and Twenty-third, at Buena Vista, northeastern

the Mexican general Santa Anna and twenty-three
thousand of the best troops of Mexico. The
commanding general desires to congratulate his
army upon this great victory of the successful

<p>“By command of Major-General Scott.</p>

<p class="noic">“<span class="smcap">H. L. Scott</span>,</p>

<p class="right">“Assistant Adjutant-General.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!” cheered the men.</p>

<p>General Worth and staff rode on, leaving excitement
in their wake.</p>

<p>“I told you so,” Hannibal cried. “Old Zach had
mostly Volunteers, too. But that made no difference.
And now you’ve seen Worth. Just like him
to publish those orders this way, instead of waiting
for parade. And fight? Oh, my! I guess <em>so</em>!”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen him before,” Jerry exclaimed, remembering.
“He jumped ashore first when you all
landed on the beach.”</p>

<p>“He did that. The First Division led and his
boat beat and he was first out. But did you see us
land? Where were you?”</p>

<p>“Here in these sand hills, cutting brush.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that a landing, though! We set a record.
General Scott and Commodore Conner of the
navy put twelve thousand men ashore in ten hours,
and all we got was wet. Never lost a life. That’s
discipline for you. Whoo-ee! Listen to those guns
talk! The dons are right angry to-day. Guess
they’ve discovered those batteries out in front. Come
on, now, if you want to see the fun.”</p>

<p>They left the camp; trudged fast until they approached
the edge of the dunes, toward the city,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
crossed a shallow trench or road that wound along,
and climbing to the top of a sand hill were in view
of the plain and the Mexican batteries. A number
of soldiers were here, watching. They had dug little
hollows, as a protection from shell fragments.</p>

<p>The firing had increased. The city and the castle
of San Ulloa were shrouded in the dense smoke;
the plain was spouting earth and brush, but it was
spouting smoke and shot and shell also, for American
batteries were replying. And the entrenched line
of blue-coats, supporting the artillery, might
be glimpsed.</p>

<p>“Those dons are trying to find our guns,”
asserted Hannibal. “That plain is full of trenches.
Golly, but it was a job to dig them. We Regulars,
and the Mohawks, too, had to work by night, in
shifts; and we got jolly well peppered, you bet. We
didn’t dare use lanterns; worked by the feel, in the
cactus and brush, and the northers near smothered us,
besides. We were marched out after dark, and
every man grabbed a spade and his orders were to
dig a hole eight feet long and five feet wide and six
feet deep. When the holes were connected they made
a ditch all ’round the city, five miles not counting
the sand-bags and parapets and battery emplacements
and caves for magazines. Then we and the sailors
dragged the guns clear from the beach, three miles
and more, through the sand and swamps. We
haven’t guns enough yet. Only sixteen out of about
sixty that the general expected. The most of ’em
are ten-inch mortars, and they’re no good for breaching
walls. The castle’s firing thirteen-inch shells
at us—sockdologers! But the navy’s helping the
army with three six-inch solid-shot guns and three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
eight-inch Paixhan shell guns, for direct fire into
the walls. Wait till that Battery Five opens. It’s
point-blank range of the walls on this side.”</p>

<p>“Is the army all ’round the city?”</p>

<p>“Yes, siree, boy. The First Division has the
right of line, starting at the beach. That’s ours.
Patterson’s Third Division Mohawks have the center.
They’re the Voluntarios. Twigg’s Regulars of the
Second Division have the left, reaching to the beach
on the other side of the city. We’ve got the Mexicanos
cooped up. They can’t sneak out.”</p>

<p>It was a great sight—those bursting shells and
those bounding solid shot, some of which ricochetted
to the dunes and rolled hither thither. Now and
then shell fragments flew past, and an occasional
long-range shell burst behind. The soldiers appeared
to enjoy the view. They seemed to know what was
coming; they all had been under fire before, and
every few moments a shot or shell might be seen
sailing above the smoke.</p>

<p>“Look out, boys! There’s a bomb—a thirteen-inch,
from the castle!”</p>

<p>“Here comes a solid shot. Lie low.”</p>

<p>“There’s an eight-inch, again.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a lull occurred in the shouts and jokes.
The men stiffened as they lay poking their heads
up. A brilliant group of officers were riding
along the shallow trench or road at the inside
base of the sand hill parapets. The foremost
was a very large man, broad shouldered and erect
and towering high upon his horse. He had a square,
stern, wrinkled face, smooth shaven except for grey
side-whiskers of regulation trim; wore a plumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
chapeau upon his grey hair, full uniform of dark blue,
with gold buttons in a double row down the front,
heavy gold epaulets on the shoulders, and broad
gold braid following his trousers seams. A sword in
engraved scabbard hung at his left side; his left
arm was curiously crooked. A splendid horse bore
him proudly.</p>

<p>All the other officers were in full uniform, too,
and kept behind him.</p>

<p>“That’s Scott! That’s General Scott! Old Fuss
and Feathers himself!” Hannibal whispered. “Now
mind your eye. No foolishness, boy.”</p>

<p>General Scott turned his horse and rode boldly
right up the sand hill, until he sat looking at the
plain and the enemy through his spy-glass. The men
promptly stood up, at salute.</p>

<p>“Keep down, keep down, men,” he gruffly
ordered. “You shouldn’t expose yourselves
this way.”</p>

<p>A solid shot whistled by him, and he never stirred.
A shell burst in front, and he never stirred. He
sat, gazing.</p>

<p>“Sure, sir, you’re exposin’ yourself, ain’t you?”
somebody called.</p>

<p>General Scott snapped his glass together, and
smiled grimly. Jerry could see his grey eyes, as he
glanced at the man. They were of a keen grey, but
kindly. There was something fatherly as well as
severe about him.</p>

<p>“Oh, as for that,” General Scott answered,
“generals, nowadays, can be made of anybody, but
men, my lad, are hard to get.”</p>

<p>He leisurely rode back to his staff; and how the
soldiers cheered!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V<br />
<small>IN THE NAVAL BATTERY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Listen!” Hannibal cried.</p>

<p>He had sharp ears. The beat of drums and the
shrill of fifes could be faintly heard, sounding from
the rear.</p>

<p>“That means us. It’s the Eighth Infantry march,
as a warning signal. Expect I’m wanted. Golly,
hope I haven’t missed musicians’ call. Old Peters—he’s
drum major—will be mad as a hornet. A drummer
never gets any rest, anyhow. Good-by. See
you again. You look me up.”</p>

<p>Away ran Hannibal, and most of the soldiers
followed.</p>

<p>“More trench work,” they grumbled.</p>

<p>The place seemed very empty. Jerry hesitated,
and wandered after. Before he got to the camp he
met a double file marching out to tap of drum, their
muskets on their shoulders. Hannibal and a fifer
led, behind a sergeant. Hannibal wore his drum,
suspended from a pair of whitened cross-belts that
almost covered his chest. He gave Jerry a wink, as
he passed, sturdily shuttling his drumsticks.</p>

<p>Jerry fell in behind, at a respectful distance; soon
he lost the file and the sound of the drum, but he
kept on, guided by wheel tracks. Next he had
arrived among the Volunteers again, where they
were laughing and lounging as before, except that
these were a different batch, at this particular spot—grimy
as if they had just come out of the trenches,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
themselves. Decidedly it was easy to tell a Volunteer
from a Regular, by the clothes and the untrimmed
hair and the free off-hand manners.</p>

<p>The sun was high and hot; a perfect day had
succeeded to the stormy night. Jerry continued,
until he struck the big trench scored by the broad
tracks. He was heading back for the naval battery;
and presently there he was, once more, his farther
way blocked by the great guns and a mass of sailors.</p>

<p>Nobody noticed him. The cross-trench for the
battery was ringing with orders and with the crash
of shells from the castle and city. The magazine
was open—a squad of sailors stood beside each gun—the
cannon were being loaded—the charges were
rammed home by two sailors to each rammer—there
was a quick order, repeated by the bo’s’ns, who
blew their whistles; and as if by magic all the brush
fringing the cannon muzzles was swept away with
cutlasses and brawny arms.</p>

<p>With a cheer the sailors holding the rope tackle
hauled hard and the enormous cannon darted silently
forward, so that their muzzles were thrust beyond
the parapet.</p>

<p>A sailor behind each breech drew his cord taut. It
was attached at the other end to a large lever, like
a trigger, connected with an upraised hammer.</p>

<p>A gunner sighted—screwed down, screwed up,
sprang aside—</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” announced the other squinting
gunners, one to each piece.</p>

<p>“Fire!” shouted the battery officer, with dash
of sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>The lock strings were jerked viciously. Such a
thunderous blast tore the air to shreds that Jerry’s
ear drums felt driven right into his head, and the suction
of the air, following the report, dragged him
upon his nose.</p>

<p>The smoke gushed wider and higher. He could
see the officers standing and peering through their
spy-glasses, at the city; they shouted—he could not
hear a word, but the smoking guns had recoiled inward
until checked by ropes and chocks; the rammers
swabbed with the swab ends of their long ramrods;
other sailors thumbed the vent holes; the swabbers
reversed their tools; sailors rapidly inserted a flannel
bag of powder into each muzzle; in it went, forced
home by the ramrods; shells for some guns, shot for
others, had been handed up—were rammed down—out
rolled the guns, to the haul on block and tackle—</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>“<em>Boom-m-m!</em>”</p>

<p>The sailors appeared to be cheering as they toiled.
The guns thundered and smoked—recoiled as if
alive and eager, were sponged and loaded and run out
again; every man was on the jump, but they all moved
like clockwork. Cowering there, back of the magazine,
and glued to the side of the trench, Jerry stared
roundly. Nobody paid any attention to him. All
were too busy to take heed of a ragged boy.</p>

<p>“<em>Bang!</em>” A return shot had arrived. It was
a shell, and had burst so near that the fragments and
the dirt rained down.</p>

<p>“<em>Bang!</em>” Another. The naval battery had
been discovered, and Jerry was under fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>The naval guns and the guns of the city forts
answered one another furiously. What a clangor
and turmoil—what a smother of hot smoke from
the cannon muzzles and the bursting shells! Solid
shot thudded in, too. They ripped across the parapet,
cutting gashes and sending the sand-bags flying.
They bounded into the trench, and lay there spinning,
ugly and black. It was hard to tell whether they
were really solid or were going to burst. Horrors!
One of the men passing ammunition had lost his
head! A solid shot skimming through the same
slot out of which a cannon muzzle pointed had taken
the man’s head off; he crumpled like a sack, and
Jerry felt sick at the red sight.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes and had to look again,
shuddering, the body was gone; another sailor—a
live one—stood in the place, and the guns were booming
as before.</p>

<p>All the guns of the city forts on this side seemed
to be firing at the naval battery. Several sailors
had been wounded; a young officer was down and
bleeding. The wounded were staggering to the rear;
one stopped and sank beside Jerry. He had an arm
dangling and crimsoned, and a bloody head.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy, matie,” he gasped. Jerry recognized
him as his first friend of the night preceding.
“You’re here again, are you? D’you know where
the sick bay is?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s aft some’ers down this bloomin’ trench.
Lend me a tow, will you? I’ve got a spar nigh shot
off and a bit o’ shell in my figgerhead. Hard for me
to keep a course, d’you see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“All right. You tell me where to take you.”</p>

<p>“Right-o, my hearty. Steady, there. P’int due
sou’-sou’east. The sick bay and the bloody sawbones’ll
be some’ers abeam. You’ll smell the
arnicky.”</p>

<p>With the shells exploding and the cannon-balls
pursuing they made way down the trench, the sailor
leaning with his sound arm on Jerry’s shoulders.</p>

<p>The sick bay, or hospital, was a sandbag-covered
room at one side; not a pleasant place—oh, no, for
wounds were being dressed and things were being
cut off by the navy surgeon and his assistant. Still,
it seemed to be safe from the shot and shell, and
there were not many wounded, yet; only four or five.
So Jerry lingered, until the surgeon espied him and
set him at work picking lint, serving water, and
so forth.</p>

<p>The reports from the battery were encouraging,
judging by the conversation. The six guns were all
in action, together: the three Paixhans, which threw
shells eight inches in diameter and weighing sixty-eight
pounds, and the three solid-shot pieces, which
threw balls, six inches in diameter, and weighing
thirty-two pounds. These were the heaviest American
guns firing yet, for breaching.</p>

<p>“Yes, shiver my timbers!” growled Jerry’s
sailor to one of the other wounded. “Scott axed
for ’em, didn’t he? Would the commodore please
to land a few o’ the navy toys and furnish the bass
in this here music? Would the navy lend the army
some genuyine main-deck guns, of a kind to fire a
broadside with and send the bloomin’ dons to Davy
Jones? ‘Bless my bloody eyes!’ says the commodore.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
‘Sartinly I will, general. But I must fight
’em.’ And ain’t we a-fightin’ of ’em? Well, I guess
we are, matie!”</p>

<p>So being navy guns, they were being “fought”
by the navy. From seven hundred yards their shot
and shell were tearing right through the walls of the
city. The astonished Mexicans were fighting back
with three batteries, all aimed at the naval battery,
to put it out.</p>

<p>The army was erecting another battery, nearby—Battery
Number 4, of the heaviest army cannon,
sixty-eight-pounders and twenty-four-pounders.
Pretty soon these would join with the navy fire.</p>

<p>The work in the sick bay slackened, and Jerry
stole up “forward” again. The din and the rush were
as bad as ever. The sailors, bared to the waist, were
black with powder grime and streaked with sweat,
on faces, bodies and arms. The guns were alive and
alert—they were monsters, belching, darting back,
fuming, while they waited to be fed, then eagerly
darting to belch once more.</p>

<p>After each shot the gun squads cheered, peering
an instant through the fog.</p>

<p>“Another for the dons’ lockers!”</p>

<p>“Hooray, lads! We’ve cut his bloomin’ flag
away.”</p>

<p>“No, no! It’s up again.”</p>

<p>Yonder, across the heaving plain, the figure of a
Mexican officer had leaped upon the parapet of a
bastion fort set in the walls and was fastening the
Mexican flag to its broken flagpole. It was a brave
act. Cheers greeted him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>The crew in front of Jerry reloaded at top speed.
The great gun spoke.</p>

<p>“They’re serving those pieces like rifles,” said
somebody, in Jerry’s ear. “By thunder, they’re
planting shot and shell exactly where they please.”
That was the surgeon, who had come forward for a
view. “But the enemy’s making mighty good practice,
too. He has German artillery officers.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the surgeon yelled, and grabbing Jerry
forced him flat.</p>

<p>“Look sharp!”</p>

<p>The parapet of the battery was scored ragged.
The gun platforms and the trench were littered with
shell fragments and spent solid shot. Now there
had sounded a soft “plump” or thud. A round black
sphere as large as Jerry’s head had landed in the
bottom of the wide space behind the guns—it was
only a few feet to the rear of the quarter-gunner who
stood holding in his arms a copper tank containing
the powder charges. Each charge weighed
ten pounds.</p>

<p>He heard the thump, and what did he do but turn
and stoop and put his hand upon the thing! Evidently
it was hot—it was smoking—a shell! Down
dived the quarter-gunner, quick as a wink, plastering
himself against the ground. There was a chorus
of startled shouts, and—“<em>Boom!</em>” the shell
had exploded.</p>

<p>The tremendous shock drove Jerry rolling over
and over. As seemed to him, the trench and the
emplacements and the battery and all the men had
been blown to bits. But when he picked himself up
amidst the dense smoke, instead of seeing bloody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
shreds everywhere, he saw the men likewise picking
themselves up and staring about dazedly. The ammunition
chest had exploded also, but even the quarter-gunner
had not been harmed. One lieutenant had
had his hat-brim torn off; that was all.</p>

<p>“A thirteen-inch bomb, from the castle,” the
surgeon remarked. “Young man, we’d better get
out of here, and stay where we belong.”</p>

<p>“Send that boy out of fire,” an officer barked.
“Now, my hearties! Show those fellows we’re
still alive.”</p>

<p>Cheering, the sailors jumped to their task.</p>

<p>His head ringing, Jerry stumbled back with the
surgeon. And at the hospital he got a quick dismissal.</p>

<p>“You heard the orders, youngster. Follow your
nose and keep going.”</p>

<p>That was good advice, when such shells were
landing and he could be of no use. So Jerry scuttled
back down the trench, hoping to run upon Hannibal
somewhere.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI<br />
<small>SECOND LIEUTENANT GRANT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Volunteer section of the trenches, extending
right and left back of the naval battery, had not
escaped the fire of the Mexican guns. It was filled
with the blue-coats and blue-caps, as before; but
shot and shell had ripped it, squads were repairing
it, under fire, by throwing up fresh sand and stowing
the sandbags more securely. The other men
crouched nervously, their muskets grasped, as if
they were awaiting the word to charge. Some of
them grinned at Jerry, when he paused to look in;
they leveled jokes at him.</p>

<p>“Did you get blown up, bub?”</p>

<p>“How’s the weather, where you’ve been?”</p>

<p>“Does your maw know you’re out?”</p>

<p>But Jerry pressed on again, “following his nose,”
and trying to dodge shell fragments; tried a short
cut among the dunes, rounded one of the numerous
lagoons or marshes, where soldiers off duty were
washing their socks; and sooner than he had expected
he had entered the camp of the Regulars,
once more.</p>

<p>He could tell it by the looks of it. The men
were better “set up” than average, seemed well
cared for, acted business like; their older officers
were brusque, the younger were stiff-backed and
slim-waisted, and as a rule they all sat or stood apart
from the soldiers.</p>

<p>The hour was after noon; he knew this by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
sun, dimly shining through the drifting smoke cloud,
and by his empty stomach—amazingly empty now
that he thought about it. But he had not laid eyes
upon Hannibal, yet, nor anybody else that he ever
had seen before.</p>

<p>He happened to stop for a moment near a young
officer. The officer was composedly standing by
himself, his hands in his pockets as if he were not at
all concerned about the racket at the front. He had
a smooth-shaven, rather square face, dark brown
hair and blue-grey eyes, and was stocky but not large.
In fact, was scarcely medium. He had a thoughtful,
resolute look, however—a quiet way, that is, which
might make anyone hesitate to tackle him for trouble.</p>

<p>He gave Jerry a slow, quizzical smile.</p>

<p>“Well, my lad, what do you want here?”</p>

<p>“Will you please tell me if this is the Eighth
United States Infantry?” Jerry asked.</p>

<p>“No. That’s in the Second Brigade. This is
the Fourth Infantry, First Brigade.”</p>

<p>“Then where is the Eighth Infantry?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“The Eighth is posted with the Second Brigade,
farther on. You’ll see the regimental flag. What
do you want with the Eighth Regiment?”</p>

<p>“I know a boy there. He promised to get me
a job.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a job?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say, but he’s a drummer boy.”</p>

<p>“You reckon on being a drummer boy? Better
not. There’s one with his arm shot off, already.”</p>

<p>“Not Hannibal!” Jerry exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Hannibal who?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“Hannibal Moss. He’s the boy I mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; not that young rascal of the Eighth.
Another boy by the name of Rome, over in the
Twiggs division. Now he’ll be a cripple for life.”</p>

<p>“Will he have to go home?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jerry, “I’d hate to have my arm
shot off, but I’d hate worse to have to go home and
miss all the rest of the fighting. Could I get his
job, do you think?”</p>

<p>The officer laughed. When he laughed, his face
lighted up.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that this army can wait until
you learn to drum. We’re liable to be busy from now
on. Where did you come from? Where are your
folks?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t any. I’ve been in the naval battery.”</p>

<p>“You have! Belong to the navy, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I don’t seem to belong anywhere. I
ran away from Vera Cruz last night. I’m an
American.”</p>

<p>“So I see. Well, how do you like the naval
battery?”</p>

<p>“It’s pretty lively,” said Jerry, shaking his head.
“They didn’t want me, there, so I came back to
the army.”</p>

<p>“You’d better go on to the rear; go down to the
beach, and some of those camp followers will take
care of you.”</p>

<p>“Are they a part of the army?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” the officer grimly answered.
“Their duty seems to lie in raking in the army’s
money as fast as they can bamboozle us. Still, the
laundresses are rather necessary. I’ll speak to some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
laundress about you, when I have opportunity. Are
you willing to scrub clothes in a tub?”</p>

<p>“No,” Jerry declared honestly. “I think I’d
rather join the army and help fight. Are you
a general?”</p>

<p>“I?” The young officer acted astonished. “Not
yet. I’m only Second Lieutenant Grant. I’m about
as far from being a general as you are.”</p>

<p>“But you’re fighting, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Not very fiercely, at present. The artillery is
doing the fighting. After the artillery has opened
the way, then the infantry will have a chance.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jerry, “I guess I’d better be
going on.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” spoke Lieutenant Grant. “I’ll
wager you’re hungry. Aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You see that tent at the end of the row?” And
Lieutenant Grant pointed. “That’s my quarters—mine
and Lieutenant Sidney Smith’s. You go there
and you’ll find a darky; or you’ll find him if he isn’t
somewhere else. He’s Smith’s servant. You tell
Pompey that Lieutenant Grant sent you to get something
to eat. Then you can tidy up my things. I
reckon,” added Lieutenant Grant, stubbornly, as if
to himself, “that I’ll show Smith I can have a bodyguard
as well as he can.”</p>

<p>“And shall I stay there?” Jerry asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“You say you want to join the army. So if
you’re willing to play understudy to a mere second
lieutenant instead of to a drum major, maybe we
can come to some agreement. At any rate, go get
a meal.”</p>

<p>Jerry hustled for the tent. The flaps were open,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
nobody was within, but on the sunny side, without,
he discovered a young darky asleep, on his back, with
a bandanna handkerchief over his face to keep
off the flies.</p>

<p>The darky was dressed in a torn whitish cotton
shirt, a pair of old army trousers, sky-blue, tied
about his waist with a rope, and gaping shoes from
which his toes peeped out.</p>

<p>He was snoring. But Jerry had to get something
to eat, according to orders.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said, gazing down.</p>

<p>The bandanna rose and fell; the snores continued.
Shot and shell and big guns made no difference
to this darky.</p>

<p>Jerry considered. He broke a twig from a scrap
of bush and tickled the toes. They twitched, the
snores changed to grunts, the bandanna wriggled,
and on a sudden with a prodigious “Oof! G’way
from dar!” the darky blew off his bandanna and
sort of burst into sitting up, staring wildly, his
eyes rolling.</p>

<p>“Who you?” he accused. “Wha’ fo’ you do
dat, ticklin’ me like one o’ dem t’ousand-leggers?
I’se gwine to lambast you fo’ dat, you white limb
o’ Satan!”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Grant said you’d find me something
to eat,” Jerry explained. “I didn’t mean to
scare you.”</p>

<p>“Scyare me? Oof! I shuah felt one o’ dem
t’ousand-legger centipeders crawlin’ right inside my
shoes. Huh! I don’t give house room to no t’ousand-leggers.
What you say you want? Who-all
sent you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>“Lieutenant Grant. He said you were to find
me something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Where am dat Lieutenant Grant?”</p>

<p>“Over there. He was there, but he’s gone now.”
For Lieutenant Grant had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Done issued me ohders, did he? I don’t belong
to no second lieutenant. I belong to Lieutenant
Smith. He fust lieutenant. If he say to feed white
trash, I got to feed ’em, but I ain’t takin’ ohders from
no second lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go back and tell him,” Jerry proffered.
“There he is.” Lieutenant Grant was in sight, talking
with another officer. Once he glanced toward the
tent; and his glance could be felt.</p>

<p>The darky hastily sprang up.</p>

<p>“Reckon I’ll find you sumpin. Yes, suh; when
anybody’s jined the ahmy he’s got to ’bey his s’perior
offercers. Come along, white boy. Where you
from, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Vera Cruz.”</p>

<p>“You from Very Cruz? What you do dar?”</p>

<p>“Worked for my keep. Last night I ran away.”</p>

<p>“You an American boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“Hi yi!” Pompey chuckled “’Spec’ Very Cruz
ain’t a place to lib in, dese days. Hi yi! Guess
when dose big bombs come a-sailin’ dey say: ‘Where
dose Mexicans? Where dose Mexicans? Here dey
be, here dey be—Boom! Now where dey be?’ Yes,
suh, white folks better get out. Bombs cain’t take
time to ’stinguish color. Gin’ral Scott, he in berry
big hurry to march on to City ob Mexico. Gwine
to spend Fo’th ob Jooly in Halls ob Montyzoomy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
eatin’ off’n golden platters. Come along, white boy.
Ain’t got nuffin’ but cold cohn pone an’ salt hoss, but
I’ll feed you. You gwine to jine the ahmy?”</p>

<p>“Hope to,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“What’s yo’ name?”</p>

<p>“Jerry Cameron.”</p>

<p>“Any kin to the No’th Car’liny Camerons?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t any folks.”</p>

<p>“Sho’, now! Dem No’th Car’liny Camerons are
mighty uppity people. Dat Lieutenant Grant, he a
fine man, too. But I’m ’tached to Fust Lieutenant
Smith, Fo’th United States Infantry. If you get
’tached to Lieutenant Grant, I’m uppitier than you
are, remember. When you work ’round with me
you got to ’bey my ohders. I’m yo’ s’perior offercer.”</p>

<p>“All right, Pompey,” Jerry agreed.</p>

<p>He munched the cornbread and salt beef, and
Pompey chattered on.</p>

<p>“Listen to dem guns talk! Oof! Talkin’ a way
right through dem walls, laike the horn ob Jericho.
Mebbe to-morrow Gin’ral Scott wave his sword, an’
Lieutenant Smith an’ me an’ all the rest de ahmy,
we fix bagonets an’ go rampagin’ ’crost dat patch ob
lebbel ground an’ capture all dem Mexicans. What
you gwine to do den?”</p>

<p>“Go, too, I guess,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“We don’t ’low no nuncumbatants along when
we-all charge,” Pompey asserted. “Ob co’se I got
to stay with Massa Smith. I’se part the ahmy. But
when dose cannon balls come a-sayin’ ‘Hum-m-m,
where dat little white boy?’, what you gwine to
do den?”</p>

<p>“I’d dodge ’em,” said Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“Wha’ dat? You dodge ’em? Now you talk
foolish. Guess you nebber fit a battle yet. We-all
am vet’rans. We-all belong to the Fo’th Infantry.
We-all fit under Gin’ral Taylor. The Fo’th Infantry
done licked dem Mexicans out o’ Texas an’ clyar
into Mexico till dar warn’t any more to lick; den
Gin’ral Scott, he said: ‘I got to have dat Fo’th
Infantry to whup Santy Annie an’ capture the City
ob Mexico.’ If you gwine to jine the Fo’th Infantry,
boy, you meet up with a heap o’ trouble. We
don’t dodge cannon balls. We hain’t time. We
jest let ’em zoop an’ we keep a-goin’.”</p>

<p>“All those cannon balls don’t hit somebody,”
said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Um-m-m. How you know? You talk laike
you’d been sojerin’. Where you hide yo’self, after
you leave Very Cruz? ’Way back on the beach?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve been in the naval battery.”</p>

<p>“Wha’ dat?” Pompey’s eyes stuck out. “Out
dar, with dose big guns? You lie, boy. How you
get dar?”</p>

<p>“I tumbled into it, last night.”</p>

<p>“Befo’ the shootin’?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I went back this morning. I stayed
as long as they’d let me. Then a big shell burst
right inside and an officer made me get out.”</p>

<p>“Sho’!” Pompey exclaimed. “You been under
fiah? ’Pears laike you don’t talk more’n Lieutenant
Grant. He’s the least talkin’est man I ebber did
see. He shuah don’t take any back seat in fightin’,
though. Um-m-m, no indeedy! Dar at Monterey
he rode so fast Mexican bullets couldn’t ketch him.
Powerful man on a hoss, dat Lieutenant Grant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
But you ’member, now, if you stay ’round hyar,
waitin’ on him, I don’t take ohders from you. You
take ’em from me. I’m sarvent to a fust lieutenant;
yo’ man’s only a second lieutenant. He may be
good man; but dat’s ahmy way. I’m yo’ s’perior in
the ahmy.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Jerry agreed again.</p>

<p>“Now I’m gwine back to sleep, an’ don’t you
tickle my toes. No, suh! I ain’t ’feared ob bombs,
but I’se drefful scyared ob t’ousand-leggers. Dar’s
yo’ side the tent, where Lieutenant Grant sleeps.
You kin tidy it up, if you gwine to stay.”</p>

<p>Pompey went to sleep, as before. Jerry found
little to do. Lieutenant Grant’s side of the tent was
in apple-pie order, not a thing misplaced. The whole
interior of the tent was as neat as a pin. There
were only a couple of cots, two canvas stools, a
folding table, two blue painted chests, with canteens,
overcoats, and a few small articles hanging up.</p>

<p>After fiddling about, Jerry strolled out. Pompey
was snoring, the guns of batteries and city and castle
were thundering, soldiers were drilling or sitting in
groups. Lieutenant Grant came walking hastily.</p>

<p>“Did that darky treat you well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I had something to eat.”</p>

<p>“That’s good.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t find much to do in the tent.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. Well, I’m on quartermaster
detail, and I may not be back to-night. You’ll have
to look out for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Can I stay?”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“With you and the Fourth Infantry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” Lieutenant Grant smiled.
“How are you at foraging?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’ll try.”</p>

<p>“Pompey’ll teach you. He’ll take eggs from a
setting hen. If Lieutenant Smith turns up and asks
who you are, you tell him you’re attached to the
Fourth Infantry as chief forager for Lieutenant
U. S. Grant.”</p>

<p>“Sha’n’t you need me any more to-day?”
Jerry asked.</p>

<p>“No. You can report in the morning. You
may sleep in my bunk to-night unless I’m there first.
That will keep the fleas from getting too hungry.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to find the Eighth Infantry and tell
Hannibal Moss I’m in the army.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant hurried on. He mounted a
horse and galloped for the beach. Jerry went seeking
the Eighth Infantry.</p>

<p>The sun was much lower in the west. The bombardment
had dwindled. It was said that ammunition
for the mortars and other guns had run short
until more could be landed through the heavy surf
from the ships. The firing of the naval battery guns
had ceased entirely.</p>

<p>By the time that Jerry had found the Eighth Infantry
the sun was setting and throughout the camp
the company cooks were preparing supper. A detachment
of sailors marched up from the beach, at
their rolling gait, to relieve the crews in the battery.
They were given a cheer.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!”</p>

<p>It was Hannibal, again. He stood up and beckoned.
Jerry gladly went over to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>“Where you going?”</p>

<p>“Looking for you, is all.”</p>

<p>“Good. Wait a minute, till after retreat. I’ve
got to beat retreat.”</p>

<p>“Do you have to retreat?” Jerry blurted, aghast.</p>

<p>“Naw; not that kind. Not for Old Fuss and
Feathers. Cracky, but you’re green! It’s evening
roll-call and parade.”</p>

<p>Through the camp drums were tapping, fifes
squeaking, horns blaring. Officers were striding, buttoning
their jackets and buckling on their swords.
Soldiers were seizing muskets from the stacks and
forming lines under their gruff sergeants. Hannibal
himself ran and grabbed his drum from a stack of
muskets, and disappeared around a tent. Sergeants
were calling the company rolls. And in a few moments
here came the regiment’s band, and the fifers
and drummers, in a broad, short column, playing
a lively march tune; led by a whopping big drum
major, in a long scarlet coat, gay with gilt braid and
cord, on his head a shako which with nodding plume
looked to be three feet high, in his hand a tasseled
staff.</p>

<p>The music formed on a level space, the band to
the fore, then a rank of fifers, then a rank of drummers—with
all the little drummer boys bursting
through their tightly fitting uniforms of red-braided
snug jackets and sky-blue long trousers flaring at the
bottoms, their swords by their sides, their drums
slung from their white cross-belts, their caps tilted
saucily. Hannibal was there, rolling his drumsticks
as lustily as the others.</p>

<p>The regiment followed, marching by companies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the stars and stripes and the regimental flag of blue
and gold at the head. The companies changed direction
into line three ranks deep, on the left of
the music.</p>

<p>“Eyes—right! Right—dress!”</p>

<p>It was funny to see those eyes.</p>

<p>“Front!”</p>

<p>The eyes gazed straight before.</p>

<p>A man on horseback, who must have been the
colonel, sat out in front.</p>

<p>“Support—arms!”</p>

<p>“Carry—arms!”</p>

<p>“Right shoulder—shift!”</p>

<p>“Shoulder—arms!”</p>

<p>“Present—arms!”</p>

<p>The band and field music marched up and down,
playing bravely. The two ranks stood motionless,
the soldiers as stiff as ramrods, their muskets held
perpendicularly in front of them. Why, compared
with these Regulars the Mexican Regulars, even the
famous Eleventh Infantry of the Line, were
only slouchers.</p>

<p>The music resumed position; the drums rolled, a
bugler lilted a kind of call.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the colonel turned his horse and
left; the company officers barked snappy orders, and
the companies were marched back to stack arms again
and be dismissed. Hannibal came rollicking without
his drum.</p>

<p>“I’m off till tattoo at half-past nine,” he announced,
to Jerry. “No guard duty. Our company’s
to rest. If I wasn’t a drummer I wouldn’t
have anything to do till to-morrow. But a drummer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
never gets much rest. He has to be Johnny-on-the-Spot
all the time. Just wait till you’re a drummer.
What you want to do? Where’ve you been
since morning?”</p>

<p>“I was up in the naval battery.”</p>

<p>“Under fire, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Guess so. A big shell burst right in front of
me, inside the battery; in the middle of us all. Didn’t
kill anybody, though. Then an officer made me get.
But I’ve joined the army.”</p>

<p>“You have? How? Already?”</p>

<p>“You bet. I’m in the Fourth Regiment.”</p>

<p>“What do you do there? A drummer? Who’s
teaching you? Old Brown?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not a drummer. I’m with the officers.
I’m attached to Lieutenant Grant.”</p>

<p>“Aw——!” and Hannibal stared. “What you
mean now? How ‘attached?’”</p>

<p>“That’s what he said. I take care of his tent
and I go along with him and the Fourth Regiment.”</p>

<p>“You do? That’s not soldiering; that’s only being
a follower. But what did you join the Fourth
for? Maybe I could have got you into the Eighth.
You ought to be a drummer. A drummer gets nine
dollars a month and he’s some pumpkins, too. He’s
no private. He wears a sword like an officer, and
has his own drill. I could have taught you the taps
and flams and drags and rolls. They’re easy. Then
maybe you’d be a drum major some day. That’s
what I intend to be.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can learn to be an officer. Lieutenant
Grant will teach me,” Jerry answered.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to be a soldier first, before you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
learn to be an officer. You ought to enlist or go to
school. Nearly all the company officers in the Regulars
went to school at West Point. The old fellows
were appointed or rose from the ranks, but most of
them fought in the War of 1812 or in Florida. Some
of the fresh civilians are jolly green when they join.
My eye! I know more than they do. But anyhow,”
Hannibal continued, as if not to be disagreeable,
“the Fourth is a good regiment, next to the Eighth.
You’ll learn, I guess. I know Lieutenant Grant. I
know all the officers. He’s got a funny name. Ever
hear it? Ulysses! That’s it. He’s not very big,
but you ought to see him stick on a horse. Come
along. Let’s go up on top of one of the hills and
watch the shells.”</p>

<p>Then, as they trudged:</p>

<p>“Here come the sailors from the battery. Jiminy,
but they’re black! It’s no sport, serving those
big guns. I’d rather be in the artillery than in the
infantry, though, if I wasn’t a drummer.”</p>

<p>The tars from the naval battery trooped wearily
by, for the beach and their ships. Black they were,
with powder, and coated with sand, so that their
eyes peered out whitely.</p>

<p>“Did you give ’em Davy Jones, Jack?” Hannibal
called smartly.</p>

<p>They grinned and growled; and one of them answered
back:</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, young hearty. Blowed their bloomin’
bul’arks all to smash, that’s wot. Hooray for
the navy!”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” Hannibal and Jerry cheered.</p>

<p>The sand hills were being occupied by officers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
men, gathered to watch the show. The best point
seemed to be awarded to a special little group—</p>

<p>“Say! We’ll have to take another,” Hannibal
exclaimed. “There’s General Scott, again—and his
engineers, too. We’ll get as close as we can. Wait.
They’re coming down. You mind your eye and I’ll
show you a fine officer.” The group, with the commanding
figure of General Scott to the fore, gazing
through glasses, seemed about to leave. “You see
that officer who’s just turned our way? Talking
to another officer? He’s Captain Robert E. Lee, of
the engineers, on Scott’s staff. He laid out these
trenches and batteries—he’s the smartest engineer in
the army. The officer he’s talking to is Lieutenant
George B. McClellan, graduated from West Point
only last summer. I know him—I knew him when
we all were under Old Zach, in the north of Mexico,
before we came here with Fuss and Feathers. He’s
smart, too, but he gets funny sometimes. Captain
Lee is the smartest of all.”</p>

<p>Upon leaving their hill the group passed nearer.
Jerry might see that Captain Lee was a slender,
dark-eyed, handsome young officer; Lieutenant McClellan
was not so good-looking—had a long nose
and a pinched face, and a careless, happy-go-lucky
manner; was slight of build. General Scott towered
over them all. What a giant of a man he was—and
with what a voice when he spoke in measured
sentences!</p>

<p>They mounted horses held by orderlies, and cantered
away, probably for headquarters where General
Scott’s large tent stood, back of the First Division
camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>Jerry and Hannibal climbed to the crest of the
sand hill. The evening had fallen; the west was
pink, and the tops of the sand hills and the towers
of the city glowed, but the dusk was gathering on the
plain and over the gulf. Down in the plain the
mortars were firing slowly, as before, one after
another, as if timed by a clock; and the city and
the castle were replying in same fashion. As the
dusk deepened the bombs could be seen. They rose
high, sailed on, leaving a streak of red from their
burning fuses, and dropped swiftly—and all the city
was lighted luridly by the burst of flame.</p>

<p>The Mexican shells crossed their tracks with
other streaks of red; and they, also, burst with great
lurid explosions, illuminating the sand hills and the
dark lines of trenches below. Sometimes there were
four and five bombs in the air at the same time, going
and coming.</p>

<p>It was a grand sight, from the outside. Jerry was
glad that he was not in Vera Cruz; and he was glad
that he was not one of the soldiers in those little
detachments that now and again hustled silently
through the hills, to enter the trenches, and do outpost
duty and repair the works, under fire.</p>

<p>“Guess to-morrow the army heavies will be helping
the navy thirty-twos and sixty-eights,” Hannibal
remarked. “Then we’ll have the walls breached,
and we’ll all go in and capture the whole shebang.
General Scott won’t sit around here, waiting. He’ll
storm the walls and have the business over with before
the yellow fever starts up. We’ve got to get
away from this low country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“What are we fighting about, anyway, Hannibal?”</p>

<p>“Fighting about, boy! To whip Mexico, of
course. Got to fetch her to time, haven’t we? ‘Conquer
a peace’—that’s what General Scott says. The
Republic of Texas has come into the United States,
and as long as Mexico says she sha’n’t, and keeps
pestering Americans and won’t pay for damages, the
only way to get a peace is to conquer it. Besides,
Mexico fired first, at the Rio Grande—killed some of
the dragoons and captured Lieutenant Thornton and
a lot more. Guess we had to fight, after that,
didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Mexico says we invaded her.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” Hannibal scoffed. “So do some
of the home papers. That’s politics. When once the
army gets to shooting then talk isn’t much use till
one side or the other is licked. They all ought to
have arranged matters before the fighting started.”</p>

<p>Until long after dark they two crouched here,
together with other soldiers, watching the bombs.
The night was clear and still, except for the smoke
and the guns. And when the castle spoke with a
thirteen-incher, and that landed, then—<em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got to go for tattoo,” said Hannibal,
with a yawn. “You’d better skip, too, or you won’t
be let in if you don’t have the countersign. After
tattoo everybody’s supposed to be bunked for
the night.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“See you in Vera Cruz, boy,” Hannibal promised.
“Bet you the Eighth will beat the Fourth,
if we storm. Sorry you aren’t one of us, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Eighth. That’s General Worth’s regiment. He was
our colonel before I joined.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay with the Fourth,” Jerry retorted. “I’ll
go sharpen Lieutenant Grant’s sword.”</p>

<p>Hannibal laughed.</p>

<p>“Those toad-stickers aren’t meant to be sharp.
They’re just for looks. But I keep mine sharp, all
right. To-morrow I’ll capture a Mexican with it.”</p>

<p>Jerry found the tent. Everything here was
quiet, except Pompey, and he was snoring. So Jerry
snuggled down upon Lieutenant Grant’s cot, under a
blanket, intending to stay awake to make certain that
it was all right; but while listening to Pompey, and to
the steady cannonade, dulled by distance, he drowsed
off—dreamed of charging and throwing shells while
he ran, with Hannibal beating a drum and the Mexican
army lying flat and shooting bullets that burst
like little bombs.</p>

<p>In the morning he was aroused by drums and
fifes. He was still in the cot. Pompey was
about to shake him, and a tall officer in undress
was laughing.</p>

<p>“Hi, you white boy! Wha’ fo’ you sleepin’ in
an offercer’s bed?” Pompey accused. “Hain’t
you manners? Heah dat reveille—an’ me cookin’
all the breakfus! Turn out. When Lieutenant Grant
come, what he gwine to do fo’ a place to sleep?”</p>

<p>“You’re Grant’s boy, are you?” the tall officer
asked. “I’m Lieutenant Smith. And in absence
of your superior officer I politely request that you
help Pompey with the breakfast. Lieutenant Grant
will be here at any moment. He’ll appreciate a
warm bed, but he’ll want it for himself.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII<br />
<small>HURRAH FOR THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE!</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“A truce! A truce! They’ve surrendered!”</p>

<p>It was afternoon again. All this morning the
cannon of both sides had been hammering away; but
the new army battery, Number 4, of four twenty-four-pounders
and two sixty-eight-pounder shell
guns or Paixhans, had joined with the naval battery.
The fire seemed to be battering the walls to pieces.
The men from the trenches, and the officers who
watched through their spy-glasses, declared that the
shells and solid shot were dismounting the Mexican
guns and tumbling the casemates and parapets upon
the heads of the gunners. The mortars were still
blowing up the buildings and the streets. The Mexican
fire was growing weaker.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant had come back just after reveille,
from all-night work in the quartermaster
department, overseeing the landing of stuff on the
beach from the transports in the offing. He had
gone to bed and had slept until noon.</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ll charge on Vera Cruz to-day?”
Jerry asked at his first opportunity; for
Pompey had been prophesying, and the waiting infantry
appeared to be a little nervous, and the old
sergeants would say neither yes nor no.</p>

<p>“That’s not for me to answer,” Lieutenant Grant
replied. “We’ll obey orders.”</p>

<p>“Vera Cruz has got to surrender, though, hasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
it? And if Old Fuss and Feathers says to charge,
we’ll charge.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” the lieutenant rapped, severely.
“Don’t let me catch you using that nickname again.
You’re speaking disrespectfully of the commanding
officer. He’s Major-General Scott. Remember
that: Major-General Winfield Scott, chief of the
United States army, and commanding this Army
of Invasion. Where did you get that name?”</p>

<p>“The men call him that; even the drummer boys
do,” Jerry apologized. “So I thought I might.”</p>

<p>“Well, the men don’t do it out of disrespect.
They know him. All the old soldiers are proud to
serve under General Scott. The drummer boys are
young rascals, without respect for anybody. So
don’t pattern on them.”</p>

<p>“Is General Scott as good a general as Old
Zach—General Taylor, I mean?”</p>

<p>“I’m not supposed to express an opinion. A
second lieutenant has no opinions to express about
his superior officers. I served under General Taylor
in Texas and northeastern Mexico. General Taylor
won all his battles; that’s the test of a general. He’s
an old hand at fighting. So is General Scott. They
were appointed to the army at the same time, 1808.
As far as I may judge, their methods are different
but equally effective. General Taylor I was privileged
to see in action. He is experienced in emergency
fighting, learned from his campaigns against
the Indians in the War of 1812 and in the Florida
War. He apparently does not plan far ahead, but
meets the emergencies as they come up, on the field,
and handles his forces in person. General Scott,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
who attained high reputation for bravery and skill
against British regular troops in the War of 1812
and is a hard student of war—in fact, has compiled
the system of tactics in use by the United States
army—relies more, I understand, upon having his
orders carried out as issued in advance and covering
the whole field. He is regarded as a master of tactics,
which, you know, means the moving of troops
upon the field, in the presence of the enemy. Strategy
is the science of moving troops to advantage before
contact with the enemy; the getting ready to fight.
Tactics may be learned in books, but strategy is
largely a gift. General Taylor is named by the
soldiers who admire him ‘Old Rough and Ready,’
and that well describes him. He is a straightforward
fighter, and opposed to all display; he places
dependence upon the natural courage of his men,
rather than upon drill. His tactics are successful.
The tactics of General Scott have brought the army
to a fine state of discipline. The American regular
army is the best in the world, and the Volunteers
will soon be not far behind. As I have not served
long under General Scott, of course I cannot say
much about his strategy when in command of a large
body of troops. One thing is sure: he has the ablest
engineers yet produced, to help him carry out his
plans, and a splendidly trained army, both officers
and rank and file, to perform his plans; and officers
and men are confident that his plans will be thoroughly
sound.”</p>

<p>With this military lecture, Lieutenant Grant
strode away.</p>

<p>Pompey chuckled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>“Hi yi! Nebber did heah Lieutenant Grant talk
so much at onct. Didn’t say nuffin’ much, neither.”</p>

<p>At noon the fire from the city had ceased. There
were rumors that the Mexican general wished to surrender.
About two o’clock the American batteries
ceased, also. Cheers spread from the advance
trenches back to the camps. A white flag had been
borne from the city to General Scott’s headquarters.</p>

<p>“A truce! A truce! They’ve surrendered!”</p>

<p>Out on the front the soldiers could be seen
scrambling from the trenches and cheering; and the
officers of the batteries stood upon the sandbags to
examine the walls at leisure with their glasses.</p>

<p>The truce, however, did not last long. The
Mexican flag went back. The general officers, who
had been called into council with General Scott, returned
to their divisions; and one of them—a burly
short-necked, red-faced, lion-looking man who was
General David Twiggs of the Second Division of
Regulars, said, in plain hearing as he rode:</p>

<p>“Humph! My boys will have to take that place
with the bayonet yet.”</p>

<p>The mortar batteries opened again. It was reported
that General Scott and Commodore Perry
(Commodore Conner had gone home) of the navy
had agreed upon an assault of the city to-morrow,
March 26, by soldiers and sailors both.</p>

<p>The mortars fired all night, in slow fashion, as if
for reminder. The city forts and the castle answered
scarcely at all. Evidently the time for the assault
was ripe. About midnight another norther came;
the worst norther to date. In the morning half the
tents were flat, everything and everybody were covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
with sand, and the trenches and the city could not
be seen through the sand cloud.</p>

<p>“We gwine to attack, jest the same,” Pompey
proclaimed. “We cain’t see the enemy; enemy can’t
see us. Fust t’ing dey know, dar we’ll be. Wind
cain’t stop bagonets. No, suh! Oof! Don’t believe
I laike dis country, nohow. If Gin’ral Scott
don’t take us away, I’se gwine back to Virginny.
Yaller feber’s done arriv. Dey’s got it yonduh
in Very Cruz, already. Mebbe we don’t want dat
Very Cruz. I ain’t pinin’ to stay ’round hyar. Nigger
don’t stand no show ’gin yaller feber. Dey say
dar’s a big passel ob Mexican sojers collectin’ in
back country to capture us when yaller feber an’
dese no’thers gets done with us. So if Gin’ral Scott
don’t quit foolin’ an’ mahch away, I’se gwine
by myself.”</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast, or about eight o’clock, the
firing stopped once more; another white flag had
been taken in to General Scott. This time it proved
to be in earnest, for the batteries did not reopen
during the day, nor during the night.</p>

<p>The surrender was set for the morning of the
twenty-ninth, at ten o’clock sharp.</p>

<p>Jerry looked up Hannibal, and learned more news
from him than he could get by listening to Lieutenant
Grant and Lieutenant Smith talk, or to Pompey
chatter.</p>

<p>“We bagged ’em both,” Hannibal asserted.
“City and castle, too. General Scott didn’t start
in to say anything about the castle. All he wanted
was the city, and then the castle would have to surrender
or starve. But the Mexican general offered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the two, and so of course we took ’em. General
Worth, of our division, and Pillow, of the Tennessee
Volunteers in the Third Division, and Colonel Totten,
chief of engineers, did the talking. The surrender’s
to be made at ten o’clock in the morning, day after
to-morrow. Who did you say the Mexican general
was?”</p>

<p>“General Morales.”</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t. He escaped and left another
general, Landero, to foot the bill. But you’ll see a
great sight when all those Mexicans march out and
pile up their guns. We took that city easy, too.
Had only two officers and nine men killed in the
army and one officer and four men killed in the navy,
and less than sixty wounded. That’s pretty good
for twenty days’ skirmishing and investing.”</p>

<p>“The Mexicans have lost a thousand, I guess,”
proffered Jerry.</p>

<p>“They ought to have surrendered sooner. The
longer they held out the worse they got it. We were
going to storm the walls this very day. The navy
was to carry the water front and the army the sides;
and there’d have been bullets and shells and solid
shot and bayonet work, all mixed.”</p>

<p>The morning for the surrender dawned clear and
calm. The orders had called for every officer and
man to clean up and wear his best uniform. So there
were preparations as if for parade.</p>

<p>“Sech a polishin’ an’ scourin’ an’ slickenin’ I
nebber did see,” Pompey complained, as he and Jerry
worked on the belts and swords and uniforms of their
lieutenants. Through all the regiment and division
the soldiers were scouring their muskets and polishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
their buttons and whitening their cross-belts and
shining their tall leather dress-hats.</p>

<p>The drums beat the assembly, which was the
signal for the companies to fall in. The troops, under
the stars and stripes and their regimental colors,
were marched to a green meadow south of the city
walls. The sailors had come ashore. They wore
their white flapping trousers, and short blue jackets,
and white flannel shirts with broad blue collars, having
a star in the corners. They, and the Regulars,
were spick and span, because they had been trained
to take care of themselves and their things. The
Volunteers were not so neat, but that was the fault of
their officers.</p>

<p>The sailors and the Regulars were drawn up in
one long line, extending nearly a mile; the Volunteers
were drawn up in another long line, facing them.
The dragoons were at the head of the double line, and
so were two mounted companies of Riflemen, and
the Tennessee Horse. By this time a great stream
of Mexican men and women and children and loaded
burros were filing out of the city gate, taking their
goods with them. General Scott had promised not
to interfere with the citizens, but nevertheless the
people were afraid.</p>

<p>Jerry himself, hastening with Pompey and a
throng of the camp followers, had his first chance
to see the whole army.</p>

<p>The generals all were here, with their staffs: General
Scott, of course, the most imposing of any, by
reason of his great size and his full uniform; the
swarthy, flashing-eyed General Worth, very handsome
on a prancing horse—he had been appointed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
receive the surrender, which was an honor to the
First Division; the white-haired, lion-like General
Twiggs (Old Davy), of the Second Division of
Regulars—his whiskers on his cheeks were growing
again, which, with his short neck and stout shoulders,
made him look more like a lion than ever; General
Robert Patterson of the Volunteer Third Division—an
old soldier of Pennsylvania, who had a rugged
face and high forehead and was known as a fighting
Irishman; and Colonel William S. Harney of the
Dragoons—another giant of a man, almost as large
as General Scott, with sunburned face and blue eyes,
and a quick, bluff manner, which just fitted a
bold dragoon.</p>

<p>Then there were the brigade commanders:
Colonel John Garland and Colonel Newman S.
Clarke of the First Division; Colonel Bennet Riley
(who had risen from the ranks) and General Persifor
Smith (the colonel of the Mounted Rifles), of
the Second Division; General Gideon Pillow the
Tennessean (a slightly built man and the youngest
of all the brigadiers), General John A. Quitman the
Mississippian (a slender man with elegant side-whiskers),
and General James Shields from Illinois
(a black-moustached Irishman), of the Volunteers.</p>

<p>But the Regular cavalry took the eye: The one
company of the First Dragoons, under young Captain
Phil Kearny, the six companies of the Second
Dragoons, and the nine companies of the Riflemen
under Major Edwin V. Sumner of the Second Dragoons,
while their own colonel, Persifor Smith, was
serving as brigadier. Only two companies of the
Riflemen were really Mounted Riflemen; the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
had lost most of its horses in a storm on the
way, and not all the dragoons were mounted, either,
for the same reason.</p>

<p>The uniform of the dragoons was short dark-blue
jackets piped with yellow, and light blue trousers with
yellow stripes down the seams, and buff saddle reinforcements
on the inside legs; cavalry boots, and
dress helmets floating a white horsehair plume. The
Riflemen (who carried rifles instead of muskatoons)
had green trimmings. It was said to be a dashing
regiment, equal to the dragoons.</p>

<p>Suddenly, at ten o’clock precisely, in the city
and at the castle of San Ulloa, down fluttered the
Mexican red, white and green tricolor flags, while
the Mexican cannon fired a salute to them; the red,
white and blue rose in their place, and the salute by
the army and navy guns was almost drowned by
the great cheer from Jerry and all the rest of the non-combatants.
The two ranks of soldiers and sailors
did not dare to cheer without orders, but they swelled
with pride.</p>

<p>And here came the Mexican army, in a long column,
out of the southern gate, with a lot more women
and children (the soldiers’ families) trudging beside,
carrying bundles.</p>

<p>There were five thousand—infantry, artillery
and cavalry—led by their bands. Their uniforms
were dazzling: green and red, light blue and white,
blue and red, whitish and red, red and yellow—many
combinations, the officers being fairly covered with
gilt and bright braid.</p>

<p>“Shuah, dey’s most all gin’rals an’ drum-majors,”
Pompey exclaimed, admiring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>In comparison, the United States uniforms of
plain navy blue and sky blue, with a little white and
a little red and a little yellow and green, looked very
business like—even the gold epaulets of the officers’
dress coats.</p>

<p>General Worth and General Landero severely
saluted one another. General Landero drew aside
with his staff. The whole Mexican army marched
down between the two lines, and out beyond the end
they were shown where to stack their muskets and
deposit their belts and other equipment and the flags.
A regiment of lancers, in green, with tall red caps
and yellow cloaks, brought up the rear, on foot, to
pile their lances.</p>

<p>Some of the Mexican soldiers looked sad; some
looked rather glad to have the matter ended. They
all were pledged by their officers not to take part in
the war again, unless exchanged for American prisoners.
Meanwhile they were permitted to go home.</p>

<p>“Reckon dey mought as well plow deir cohn,”
Pompey chuckled. “’Case why? ’Case dar won’t
be anybody to exchange ’em fo’.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII<br />
<small>INSPECTING THE WILD MOHAWKS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>After the surrender the army camp was moved
out of the sand hills and to the beach. That was
a great relief—to be away from the swamps and
thickets and dust and the thousands of small flies
and millions of fleas. Some of the clever officers
had been greasing themselves all over with pork
rind and sleeping in canvas bags drawn tightly
around their necks; but even this did not work.</p>

<p>General Worth was appointed military governor
of Vera Cruz; another honor for the First Division.
General Quitman’s brigade of Mohawks was put in
as garrison.</p>

<p>The men were granted leave, in squads, to go
into Vera Cruz. And Vera Cruz was a sad sight,
as Jerry found out when he and Hannibal strolled
through. The bombs from the mortars had crashed
through the tiled roofs of the buildings, burst the
walls apart, and had made large holes in the paved
streets. It was dangerous to walk because of the
loosened cornices of the roofs. The beautiful cathedral
had been struck; it now was a hospital, containing
hundreds of wounded soldiers and civilians.</p>

<p>But the most interesting thing to “military men”
was the wall on the side of the city toward the naval
battery. The sixty-eights and thirty-twos had hewed
two openings—had simply pulverized the coral rock
laid twelve feet thick; and a wagon and team might
be driven through either gap. The bastions, also,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and the outlying batteries, had been knocked
to smithereens.</p>

<p>Yet it was astonishing how quickly American rule
was bringing order. The streets were being rapidly
cleaned up by squads of soldiers and by the Mexicans
who were hired. Shops were doing a big business—the
soldiers, especially the Volunteers, were gorging
themselves with fruits and vegetables and cakes. The
harbor was again crowded with masts, of American
transports and merchantmen flying many flags. The
sea-wall was a regular market, piled with bales and
boxes and crates for the army, and thronged with
people white, yellow and black, who set up stalls,
or crowded around the huge naval guns hauled there
to be placed back upon the ships of Commodore
Perry’s squadron. A new wharf was being built,
extending out clear to the coaling depot that had
been erected upon the reef near the castle, at the
entrance to the harbor.</p>

<p>Assuredly old Vera Cruz was being Americanized.
But although everything was under strict
martial law, and one negro camp follower who had
frightened a Mexican woman had been promptly tried
and hanged, Jerry never caught a glimpse of the
two Manuels among all the Mexicans who stayed
in safety.</p>

<p>He was not now afraid of the two Manuels. They
had cuffed him and had sneered at the “gringos”—but
here the gringos were, unbeaten! And Vera
Cruz belonged to the Mexicans no longer.</p>

<p>In a short time the camp was moved again, to the
plain between the city and the sand hills. The men
had been rested; they were set at work drilling. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
soon as horses and mules and wagons arrived from
the United States, the march for the City of Mexico
would be begun.</p>

<p>“Let’s go over to the Volunteer camp and watch
the foot Mustangs drill,” Hannibal proposed, one
afternoon. “That’s great fun.”</p>

<p>So they went to the Third Division camp. A
number of companies were being put through their
drill, according to the tactics of General Scott. The
Kentuckians (a regiment newly arrived) were exercising
in the manual of arms.</p>

<p>“Eyes—right!”</p>

<p>“Eyes—left!”</p>

<p>“Front!”</p>

<p>“Shoulder—arms!”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> In Scott’s Tactics “shoulder arms” was the same as
“carry arms.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Secure—arms!”</p>

<p>“Shoulder—arms!”</p>

<p>“Order—arms!”</p>

<p>“Rest!”</p>

<p>“Attention—company!”</p>

<p>“Shoulder—arms!”</p>

<p>“Right shoulder—shift!”</p>

<p>“Shoulder—arms!”</p>

<p>“Charge—bayonets!”</p>

<p>“Shoulder—arms!”</p>

<p>“Load in twelve times—load!”</p>

<p>Then—</p>

<p>“Open—pan!”</p>

<p>“Handle—cartridge!”</p>

<p>“Tear—cartridge!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>Every soldier tore the end of the paper cartridge
open with his teeth.</p>

<p>“Prime!”</p>

<p>A little of the powder was emptied into the pans
of the guns.</p>

<p>“Shut—pan!”</p>

<p>“Cast—about!”</p>

<p>At that, the soldiers dropped their guns upright,
and prepared to pour the powder in from the
cartridge.</p>

<p>“Charge—cartridge!”</p>

<p>The powder was dumped into the muzzles, and
the ball and cartridge paper for a wad, were forced
in after.</p>

<p>“Draw—rammer!”</p>

<p>“Ram—cartridge!”</p>

<p>“Return—rammer!”</p>

<p>“Shoulder—arms!”</p>

<p>Or perhaps—</p>

<p>“Ready!”</p>

<p>“Aim!”</p>

<p>And while one held one’s breath, expecting a
volley—</p>

<p>“Recover—arms!”</p>

<p>This left them at a “ready,” again.</p>

<p>“That load in twelve times is only for discipline,”
Hannibal scoffed. “To teach ’em to work together.
Load in four times is the Regulars’ way, by count—one,
two, three, four. But mostly it’s ‘Load at will—load!’
I’d hate to be a Volunteer. They can fight,
though. Yes, siree; they can fight. They’re not
much on discipline, and they yell and sing and straggle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
while marching; but when they see the enemy—my
eye!”</p>

<p>These Volunteers were indeed a lively and good-natured
if rather rough set. When drill was over
they raced for their messes and proceeded to loll
about and cook and eat and sing, as if they had no
thought in the world except to picnic. The rust on
their guns and the length of their beards never
bothered them at all.</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p>This was the song of one group, who were drinking
from tin cups.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Molly is the gal for me——</div>

<p class="noi">sang another group. And—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the hill he turned,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And the soldier leant upon his sword</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>A tall bearded Tennesseean was singing that,
while his companions listened soberly.</p>

<p>But a chorus welled and spread until all the groups
were joining in.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“They sang that stuff all through Texas and
North Mexico,” said Hannibal. “It’s the Mohawk
war cry. And the Mexicans think it’s a sort of
national song, like some of theirs. You ought to hear
’em try to sing it themselves. ‘Gringo, gringo,’ they
say, instead of ‘Green grow,’ and they call the Americans
‘gringos’!”</p>

<p>“That’s right; they do,” Jerry agreed, remembering
the two Manuels and other Vera Cruzans.
“They called me a ‘gringo’ whenever they were
mean, but it wasn’t Spanish and they didn’t seem to
know where it came from. ‘Gringo!’ Huh!”</p>

<p>Now he understood at last.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got to go back for that blamed ‘retreat,’”
Hannibal grumbled. “Thunder! I never
did see the use in all this parading every day.”
Which was an odd remark for a Regular and
a veteran.</p>

<p>They were just leaving the mess fires of the
Mohawks, when there was a great shout of laughter,
and out of the brush here came a big Illinoisan, a dead
turkey in one hand and his long musket in the other,
driving before him two ragged Mexicans.</p>

<p>“What you got there, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Part the Mexican army, boys. <a href="#i_125">’Peared like
they were going to ambush me and take this turkey</a>;
but I said ‘Nary, Mary Ann,’ and fetched ’em along
with help of old Sal.” And he flourished his gun.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_125">
  <img src="images/i_125.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_125">“’PEARED LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO AMBUSH ME AND TAKE
THIS TURKEY”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“We meant no harm, good Americanos,” the
Mexicans whined. “We are only poor countrymen.”</p>

<p>“Pass your turkey over to us,” the soldiers cried,
to Bill. “Tell your <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paisanos</i> to git and come back
with the rest of their army.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“I know them!” Jerry exclaimed. “They aren’t
in the army. They’re brush cutters.” He ran aside.
“Hello, Manuel.”</p>

<p>The two Manuels had been cringing and smiling
and repeating: “Good Americanos! Valiant soldiers!
Do not harm us, and God will reward you.”
They saw Jerry, and recognized him. “Gringo
puppy,” they hissed. “Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m a gringo,” Jerry answered. “And
I’m in the army of the Americans. You said they
couldn’t take Vera Cruz. What do you say now?”</p>

<p>“They took Vera Cruz by standing off and killing
all the people,” old Manuel snarled, in Spanish.
“But wait, till they try to march on. Our Santa
Anna and fifty thousand brave men are coming to
meet them. Hear that, gringito? You’ll wish you’d
stayed in the brush with old Manuel.”</p>

<p>Jerry laughed. He told Hannibal what had been
said, and Hannibal laughed. As they went on they
looked back. The two Manuels were scuttling out of
the camp, unharmed, for the soldiers were more
interested in the turkey.</p>

<p>Teams and cavalry mounts, and wagons and supplies
were very slow in arriving, so that the army
stayed in camp at Vera Cruz for over a week without
a move. The yellow fever increased—only
the fresh lively air blown in by the northers had held
it down; and as soon as the northers ceased then
the vomito would rage as usual. A large number of
the men, especially the Volunteers, were ill with disease
caused by drinking bad water and by over-eating.</p>

<p>General Scott reorganized the army for the march
inland. The general orders changed the assignment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of the regiments very little, and left them as follows:</p>

<p>First Regular Division, Brevet Major-General
William J. Worth commanding: Light Battery A,
Second Artillery; Second Artillery, eight companies,
as infantry; Third Artillery, four companies, as infantry;
Fourth Infantry, six companies; Fifth Infantry,
six companies; Sixth Infantry, five companies;
Eighth Infantry, seven companies.</p>

<p>Second Regular Division, Brigadier-General
David E. Twiggs commanding: Light Battery K,
First Artillery; howitzer and rocket company;
Mounted Rifles, nine companies; First Artillery as
infantry; Fourth Artillery, six companies, as infantry;
Second Infantry, nine companies; Third Infantry,
six companies; Seventh Infantry, six companies.</p>

<p>Third or Volunteer Division, Major-General
Robert Patterson commanding: Third Illinois,
Fourth Illinois; Second New York, ten companies;
First Tennessee, Second Tennessee; First Pennsylvania,
ten companies; Second Pennsylvania, ten companies;
South Carolina, eleven companies; Kentucky,
and a detachment of Tennessee cavalry.</p>

<p>The enlistment term of the Georgians and
Alabamans had almost expired, so they were
not included.</p>

<p>The company of engineers, which contained
Captain Lee and Lieutenant McClellan and Lieutenant
Beauregard and other smart young officers, was
independent; and so were the ordnance or heavy artillery
company and the dragoons.</p>

<p>Each division had been broken into brigades as
before; and although Jerry’s Fourth Infantry and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
Hannibal’s Eighth Infantry were still in separate
brigades they were in the First Division, anyway.</p>

<p>Subtracting the General Quitman brigade of
South Carolinans (the Palmettos), Alabamans and
Georgia Crackers, and the Tennessee cavalry, who
were to garrison Vera Cruz, the army numbered between
eight and nine thousand officers and men—not
many for a march into Mexico and a fight with
General Santa Anna’s thirty or fifty thousand.</p>

<p>Jerry proceeded to learn the drum, with Hannibal
as instructor. The drumsticks proved tricky—there
seemed to be a lot of rigmarole and Hannibal
was a hard drillmaster; but who might tell what
would happen in the coming battles? Young Rome,
drummer boy in the Twiggs division, had been disabled
already. So it behooved a fellow to be prepared
to fill a vacancy.</p>

<p>For the army there were drills and evolutions “in
masse,” as they were styled, with General Scott himself
commanding. And a grand spectacle that was,
when the infantry wheeled, and the artillery galloped,
and the dragoons spurred, all upon the plain under
the walls of Vera Cruz crowded with townspeople,
gathered to view the sight.</p>

<p>On the evening of April 7 there was a last parade
by the troops together, and a speech by General
Scott, in which he promised that if the men would
follow him he would take them through.</p>

<p>In his gold-buttoned blue frock coat, and his gold-braided
blue trousers, with gold epaulets on his broad
shoulders and a gold sash around his waist and a
plumed cockaded chapeau upon his grizzled head, his
tasseled sword in its engraved scabbard hanging at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
his side, he sat his horse and thundered his words
so that almost every ear could hear. He called the
troops “My brave boys”—and at the close of the
speech they roundly cheered their “Old Fuss and
Feathers,” the “Hero of Chippewa”—that battle
in the War of 1812 where he showed the enemy that
the American infantry was equal to the best.</p>

<p>The march onward was supposed to commence
the next day, April 8; but—</p>

<p>“’Peahs laike we Gin’ral Worth men ain’t
gwine,” Pompey complained. “I heah Lieutenant
Smith sayin’ we ain’t gwine yet. We-all got to stay.
Wha’ fo’ we-all called Fust Division, when we
ain’t fust?”</p>

<p>Jerry had seen little of Lieutenant Grant lately;
the lieutenant had been acting as quartermaster of the
Fourth and was kept busy. Now when asked about
the march, he replied shortly:</p>

<p>“Yes. The Second Division leads. General
Worth is required here; but you can depend upon it
we’ll be on hand for the fighting.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX<br />
<small>THE HEIGHTS OF CERRO GORDO</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“The general’s gone, as I suppose you know,
Grant,” Lieutenant Smith remarked to Lieutenant
Grant, at dinner this noon.</p>

<p>The day was April 12. The camp was much
smaller than it had been throughout the week following
the fall of Vera Cruz. Early in the morning of
April 8 the Second Division had marched away, with
the fifes and drums and the bands playing Yankee
Doodle. Preceded by the two horse companies of
the Mounted Rifles the long column had wound out
over the National Road for the City of Mexico, two
hundred and seventy-five or eighty miles westward,
as the road ran.</p>

<p>General Scott had been growing impatient with
the delays in the arrival of wagons and animals.
He wished to move all the troops to Jalapa, at least,
which was in the mountains about seventy miles west.
There they would be free of the dreaded vomito.</p>

<p>So on the next day, April 9, the General Patterson
Third Division of Volunteers had started. General
Patterson himself was on sick list, and General Pillow
commanded in his place. The Mohawks had
stumped gaily out, singing and shouting.</p>

<p>The general orders had directed that each division
take a wagon train carrying six days’ rations for the
men and three days’ oats for the animals. There
would be little forage on the way to the City of
Mexico until Jalapa had been reached, in the high
country. After the Mohawk division had left, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
were plenty of wagons but few animals remaining
for the First Division. The Mexican horses and
mules were small, poor creatures. Beside them the
American animals were giants. A siege train of
six heavy guns was being prepared also. And the
First Division had had to wait.</p>

<p>But now—</p>

<p>“The general gone?” Lieutenant Grant answered.
“That’s good news. We’ll soon be gone, too, then.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and we’re in for a lively brush, according
to reports. Twiggs and Patterson have run up
against the whole Mexican army at Plan del Rio,
fifty miles inland. Santa Anna’s said to be there in
person, with all the troops he can muster, on the hills
commanding the road where it passes through a
gorge in climbing the mountains. So the general
has set out with Lee and Phil Kearny’s First Dragoons
to see for himself. We’ll be needed, all right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make application to be relieved of this quartermaster
duty and permitted to serve with my company,”
Lieutenant Grant declared. “I wouldn’t miss
that battle for a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Grant, he want to fight,” Pompey
chuckled, while he and Jerry cleared away the mess
dishes after dinner. “What you gwine to do, when
dey’s a-fightin’ dem Mexicans?”.</p>

<p>“Going to keep along where I can see, anyhow,”
Jerry asserted.</p>

<p>“Sho’, now; battlefield’s no place fo’ boys,” Pompey
rebuked. “Ain’t no place fo’ dis nigger, neither.
You an’ me is nuncumbatants. We got to tend to
camp, so’s to have hot victuals ready. Fightin’ is
powerful hungry work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>This afternoon orders were issued to the regiments
of the First Division to prepare to break camp
in the morning. That was good news to everybody.
Hannibal was as jubilant as the rest. There were
all kinds of rumors but they sifted down to the one
fact: that General Santa Anna, who had been so
badly defeated by General Taylor on Washington’s
Birthday last February, at Buena Vista in northeastern
Mexico, had moved his forces eight hundred
miles across the mountains and deserts clear to the
City of Mexico, had rallied another large army of
Regulars, National Guards and Volunteers, and was
now fortified two hundred miles east of the city—and
all in time to confront the army of General Scott!</p>

<p>The First started the next morning, April 13,
accompanied by the engineers and a detachment of
the Second Dragoons. Light marching orders was
the word—but at that, what with the muskets which
weighed fourteen pounds, and the cartridge boxes
which weighed eight pounds, and the haversacks and
knapsacks and blanket rolls and heavy belts, the canteens
of water, bayonets in scabbards, and so forth,
every man carried about forty pounds not including
his woollen clothing. The tents and the extra clothing
were left at Vera Cruz; Lieutenant Smith and
Lieutenant Grant left their chests and spare outfits—and
Jerry rejoiced, for he now had little to guard.
He could do about as he pleased, except he had to
tend camp when necessary. But everybody took
three days’ rations.</p>

<p>Thereupon he boldly marched beside Company B,
Lieutenant Grant’s company.</p>

<p>Only General Quitman, with the South Carolinans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
the Georgians and the Alabamans and most
of the Tennessee horse, remained in Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>The column of cavalry, artillery and infantry
stretched long. The canteens and the tin cups clinked,
the heavy shoes clumped, the dragoon horses clattered,
the artillery and the wagons rumbled, and the
dust rose in a white cloud.</p>

<p>Trudge, trudge, trudge, with the bands and the
fifes and drums playing marching tunes—“Yankee
Doodle,” “Will You Come to the Bower” (the
Texas battle song of independence, that), “Turkey in
the Straw,” “Hail, Columbia!”, and so on, and the
men marching at will. The dragoons and General
Worth and staff headed the column, the guns of
Colonel Duncan’s flying battery came next, the sturdy
infantry and the artillery serving as infantry followed,
the wagon train toiled in the rear. And midway
Jerry, clad in an old cut-down pair of army
trousers, and an old army shirt, with a ragged straw
hat on his crown and no shoes on his feet, ambled
beside Company B, keeping as close to Lieutenant
Grant as he dared. Pompey was somewhere, probably
stealing a ride in one of the wagons.</p>

<p>The road was a poor road for one called
“National,” the main road to the capital. It was
ankle deep in sand. Soon the soldiers were sweating
and panting. When a halt was made about three
miles out, at a stream, they began to overhaul their
knapsacks and haversacks, and throw things away.
Presently the route was strewn with stuff, although
the wise ones hung to their blankets and great-coats
and rations, if nothing else.</p>

<p>Trudge, trudge, clinkity-clink, all that day, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
all the next day, while the mountains gradually
loomed higher and higher before. On the third
day they had arrived at the Puente National, or
National Bridge, where the road crossed the Antigua
River. Now the mountains and the Plan del Rio
were only sixteen miles onward.</p>

<p>General Worth ordered camp here to rest the
division. He himself went forward to consult with
General Scott. This day of April 16 was a nervous
day in the bivouac. The men all were held together,
forbidden to wander from the lines. But the dragoons
who reconnoitred ahead said that they had
seen the Twiggs and Patterson divisions encamped
and waiting down near Plan del Rio village beside
the Rio del Plan, at the foot of the mountains—probably
right under the Mexican army.</p>

<p>An aide brought back orders from General
Worth. Hannibal saw him come galloping, and
soon knew what was up.</p>

<p>“Reveille is to sound at eleven-thirty to-night,
and we’re to move camp in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Then what, Hannibal?” Jerry asked.</p>

<p>“Tell you later. A battle, I expect. Old Fuss
and Feathers will have a scheme.”</p>

<p>The men slept on the ground without tents,
Lieutenant Smith and Lieutenant Grant did not
undress, for what was the use? Reveille sounded at
eleven-thirty, the assembly followed, and the companies
fell in, the men yawning and grumbling. The
night was pitchy dark; the column went stumbling
up the road, with the soldiers staggering aside as if
asleep on their feet. It seemed as though that night’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
march never would end; and at daybreak, when
halt was sounded, everybody was glad indeed.</p>

<p>But what a panorama that was as the sun rose.
It was well worth staying awake for. Yonder, below
the slope up which the night’s march had led, there
appeared the camps of the two other divisions, near
the little village in a level bottom or valley. The
river issued from a gorge in the mountains and flowed
rapidly down past the village, on the left or south.
There were precipices and high hills on both sides of
it; and on the right or north the National Road, obliquing
from the river and village, zigzagged up into
the hills, and crossed the mountains.</p>

<p>This was the Pass of Cerro Gordo. The highest
crest—a huge round-topped hill—four miles distant
in the midst of the other hills along the road, was
Cerro Gordo itself: Big Mountain, or Telegraph Hill.
The officers said that with their glasses they could see
the Mexican flags floating from its very summit, over
batteries, and over a stone tower.</p>

<p>“Gin’ral Scott, he got to shed his coat an’ get
to work, I reckon,” declared Pompey, who had appeared
at each night’s camp. “How we-all gwine to
trabbel on with dose Mexicans rollin’ rocks down on
us? An’ dar ain’t no road ’t all odder side the ribber.
’Spec’ we mought have to make wings an’ fly ober
dose mountings. Don’t see no odder way.”</p>

<p>Aha! The troops below were already in motion.
At any rate, one column was moving out, and filing
into the hills on the north of the road. Marched
like Regulars; must be the Second Division! Was
the battle about to begin, before the First Division
received orders? But when, after a hasty breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
the division hurried down and camped near the
Third Division, soldier talk explained matters.</p>

<p>The Second and Third Divisions had been here
two or three days, lying low and wondering how to
get past Cerro Gordo. When the Third had joined
the Second, General Twiggs had decided to storm
Cerro Gordo, anyhow, and had given instructions to
General Pillow. He was a fighting man, this General
Twiggs. But General Patterson had heard and had
galloped forward from his bed to take command
and veto the orders. Being a major-general, he outranked
Old Davy, who was only a brigadier. The
men had been rather glum at the idea of storming
Cerro Gordo from the road—that looked like a sure-death
job; and when they learned that nothing would
be done until General Scott came in, they felt
mightily relieved.</p>

<p>General Scott had arrived on the fourteenth. He
immediately sent Captain Lee of the engineers out to
examine the country. Captain Lee reported that by
following a deep brushy ravine around to the northwest,
if the guns and men could be got through then
Cerro Gordo might be flanked and attacked from the
rear. Santa Anna faced the road, of course, thinking
that the principal attack would be made from
that. The Americans were not goats or rabbits;
they would have to march by the road. And Cerro
Gordo and the other batteries (quite a number) commanded
all the zigzags and switchbacks by entrenchments
and breastworks two miles in length. His
artillery and his muskets, manned by twelve or thirteen
thousand soldiers, would simply pulverize
that road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>It had looked like a problem to General Twiggs
and Generals Pillow and Patterson; but Captain Lee
seemed to have solved the problem. General Scott
approved the plan. Pioneers were dispatched at once
to open a trail around to the north that cannon might
be hauled; the Second Division had marched this
morning, to take position and seize, as was said, a hill
that the Mexicans had neglected to fortify.</p>

<p>The day, April 17, was a fine one, with just
a little sea breeze wafting in from the gulf and Vera
Cruz, fifty miles east. The stars and stripes fluttered
over the camps of the First and Third Divisions;
but the Second Division apparently did not
intend to come back. Upon the mountain crests three
and four miles west the Mexican flags fluttered. All
was quiet there. General Santa Anna seemed to
have no suspicion that anything especial was happening.
He waited for the Americans to advance.
General Scott knew exactly what was happening and
what was going to happen. He issued his orders
for battle.</p>

<p>First they were given to the division commanders.
The division adjutants furnished copies of
them to the brigade commanders; the brigade adjutants
transmitted them to the regimental commanders;
and soon the company officers who were
keen knew them also.</p>

<p>“Now we gwine to see what kind ob strateegis’
Gin’ral Scott am,” Pompey pronounced. For
Lieutenant Grant had made a copy of the orders
where posted, and he and Lieutenant Smith discussed
them.</p>

<p>“The enemy’s whole line of entrenchments and
batteries will be attacked in front, and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
time turned, early in the day to-morrow—probably
before ten o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,” said the first paragraph of
these General Orders No. 111.</p>

<p>“Hi golly!” Pompey chuckled. “We gwine
to slam him in the face an’ in the back, same time.
Dat’s proper.”</p>

<p>“The Second Division of Regulars is already advanced
within easy turning distance toward the
enemy’s left. That division has instructions to move
forward before daylight to-morrow, and take up
position across the National Road in the enemy’s
rear, so as to cut off a retreat toward Jalapa.”</p>

<p>“We got dose Mexicans retreatin’ already,”
chuckled Pompey, while Jerry listened with all
his ears.</p>

<p>The Second Division was to be reinforced by
General Shields’ brigade of Volunteers.</p>

<p>“The First Division of Regulars will follow the
movement against the enemy’s left at sunrise to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“Hi! Dat’s us,” Pompey announced. “We
gwine to be dar fo’ the leavin’s.”</p>

<p>General Pillow’s brigade of Volunteers was to
attack from the front, or the river side, as soon as
he heard the sounds of battle in the north.</p>

<p>“The enemy’s batteries being carried or abandoned,
all our divisions and corps will pursue with
vigor. The pursuit may be continued many miles,
until stopped by darkness or fortified positions, toward
Jalapa. Consequently, the body of the army
will not return to this encampment, but be followed
to-morrow afternoon or early the next morning, by
the baggage trains of the several corps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>General Scott therefore was confident. He had
no notion of being beaten; he made no mention of
what to do in case that his troops were driven back.
All his order read: “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Twiggs has the honors this time,” Lieutenant
Smith remarked. “Why, that old fire-eater will capture
the whole bag before the rest of us ever catch up
with him!”</p>

<p>The Second had a good head start, at least. Then,
shortly after noon, a wave of heavy gunfire rolled in
from the northwest—the direction taken by the
Twiggs division. Great clouds of smoke welled up,
three miles distant; the heights of Cerro Gordo were
veiled, and the smoke extended down and rose again.</p>

<p>The Second Division was in battle! General
Scott evidently had expected this. In about an hour
the long roll beat for General Shields’ brigade, in
the Volunteer camp; out they went, at quick time—the
Second New York and the Third and Fourth
Illinois, and three twenty-four-pounders.</p>

<p>General Scott himself might be seen, sitting his
horse, upon a little rise of the valley bottom, gazing
steadily at the smoke through his glass. Very calm
and collected he appeared. His aides galloped forward
as if to get the news.</p>

<p>All that afternoon the booming of cannon and
the drumming of musketry continued. No bad news
came back. At sunset the firing died away. An aide
from General Twiggs raced in and reported to General
Scott. Speedily there were cheers.</p>

<p>Captain Gore of the company hastened forward
to learn what he might. He returned.</p>

<p>“The movement by General Twiggs has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
entirely successful, men. The American flag is now
established upon a hill directly opposite Telegraph
Hill, within easy range of the rear of the enemy’s
defenses. Colonel Harney’s Mounted Rifles and the
First Artillery, supported by the Seventh Infantry,
carried it in gallant style, and General Shields’ brigade
is reinforcing with men and guns. The first
stage of the battle has been won.”</p>

<p>“An’ will we get into the foight, cap’n, plaze,
sorr?” old Sergeant Mulligan asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll do our level best, sergeant. All we want
is the chance.”</p>

<p>This was an uneasy night. The men persisted in
talking among themselves until late. The veterans
who had fought in other battles cracked jokes and
told stories, and the few new men were nervous.
The sergeants and corporals in vain cautioned:
“Silence! Go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant lay under his blanket in the
open, for the tents were far behind. The night was
sultry; showers of rain fell, wetting the blankets.
Pompey himself chattered less than usual and Jerry
felt serious. To-morrow there was going to be a
great battle of eight thousand American soldiers
against twelve thousand Mexican soldiers, strongly
fortified on the hills.</p>

<p>“Cerro Gordo hill is the key to the field,” Lieutenant
Grant had said “That of course must be
taken, and all the operations will concentrate upon it.”</p>

<p>The First Division did not know till later, but
all this night the Illinois and New York Volunteers
were working like Trojans, dragging the three
twenty-four-pounders, under direction of Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Lee and Lieutenant Hagner of the Ordnance, through
the brush and over the rocks and tree trunks, and
up the hill. The men were divided into two detachments.
One detachment rested while the other detachment
hauled and shoved; then the working
detachment blocked the wheels and lay panting while
the first detachment buckled to. It was not until
three o’clock in the morning, that amidst the darkness
and the rain the three guns were placed in position
to open fire upon Telegraph Hill.</p>

<p>Down in the camp at Plan del Rio reveille was
sounded before daylight. Breakfast was eaten in the
pink of dawn. And listen! The day’s battle had
commenced! Cannon were bellowing from the Second
Division’s hill—sending grape and solid shot into
the Mexican entrenchments upon Telegraph Hill.
The Mexicans were replying.</p>

<p>Huzzah! The long roll sounded, signaling to the
men to be alert.</p>

<p>“Fall in! Fall in!” the sergeants shouted; and
the assembly was not needed. Company B was ready
in a jiffy, the men with muskets in hand, their cartridge
boxes and bayonet scabbards in place, their
knapsacks and their haversacks with two days’ rations
hanging from their shoulders. They formed a
single rank facing to the right.</p>

<p>“Front face!”</p>

<p>They faced together, in company front.</p>

<p>“In three ranks, form company! By the left
flank! Left face! March!” barked First Sergeant
Mulligan.</p>

<p>That done, Company B was three men (or files)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
deep; and Sergeant Mulligan turned it over to Captain
Gore.</p>

<p>“Number off!” the captain ordered.</p>

<p>The men numbered.</p>

<p>“Shoulder—arms! To the rear, open order—march!
Front!”</p>

<p>Now the company was in opened ranks. The
lieutenants and the first sergeant quickly passed behind,
examining the cartridge boxes to see that all
were filled.</p>

<p>“Fix—bayonets!”</p>

<p>“Close order—march!”</p>

<p>To the color had been sounded.</p>

<p>“By the right flank—right face—forward—march!”
And Company B marched to its position
at the head of the Fourth Regiment, for it was
the color company.</p>

<p>Jerry followed. He had no idea of being left
behind; he determined to keep his eyes upon Lieutenant
Grant, and he paid no attention to the whereabouts
of Pompey.</p>

<p>General Worth, stately and handsome, his black
eyes flashing, was sitting his horse. Colonel Garland,
of the First Brigade, issued sharp orders, which were
repeated by the galloping brigade adjutant to the
regimental commanders, and by them to the company
officers. The gunfire among the hills had waxed
tremendous. The General Pillow brigade of Volunteers
was about to move.</p>

<p>General Worth lifted his sword—his orders had
meant “Forward!” The companies broke into platoons
and away they tramped, at quick step, in long
column again, the fifes and drums playing merrily.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
The Pillow brigade was coming. Those Pennsylvanians
and Tennesseeans had been directed to storm
Telegraph Hill from in front, if possible; they had
several batteries to carry, first. No pleasant job,
that; and all as a feint to hold the Mexicans occupied
on the roadside.</p>

<p>The First Division branched to the right, and into
the brush through which the pioneers had hacked a
rough trail. The faces of the soldiers were stern;
some white, some red, with excitement. The battle
clamor arose so loud that the drums and fifes could
scarcely be heard. A dense cloud of smoke covered
the hills before. Were those cheers, mingled with
the bellowing of cannon and the roll of muskets?
From whom—the Mexicans or the blue-coats? Jerry
stumbled as he half ran, trying to stay close to
Lieutenant Grant.</p>

<p>The trail was cumbered with tree trunks and rocks
and cactus. After a time the Fourth Regiment
rounded the base of a hill, and emerged at a ravine
running crosswise, at the very foot of Telegraph
Hill itself. Upon the top of the first hill cannon were
thundering. And look! The hither slope of the
other hill was alive with men, toiling up in ragged
lines, following the colors. They were blue-coats—Regulars!
The standard of the Mounted Rifles
waved on the left, in the ravine. The Mexican batteries
and entrenchments were shooting down upon
the storming columns, the Rifles were deploying and
facing a charge upon the stormers’ flank; and from
the top of the first hill the twenty-four-pounders
were pouring grape and ball across, into the higher
hill, El Telegrapho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!” The First Division
quickened pace, so eager the men were to get
into the fight.</p>

<p>“Form company! First platoon—right oblique—quick—march!”
And—“Left into line, wheel!”
the adjutant shouted.</p>

<p>“To the left, into line—quick—march!” shouted
Captain Gore to Company B.</p>

<p>The men obeyed at a run. The division was
forming line of battle.</p>

<p>“Forward—center guide—quick time—march!”</p>

<p>The drums tapped briskly. They had crossed the
head of the ravine, they began to scramble up the
slope, at last, in the wake of the Second Division
stormers. The brush and rocks were reddened,
strewn with knapsacks, and dotted with dead and
wounded; the climb was very steep. A perfect pandemonium
raged above. Bullets and grape-shot were
whistling overhead. The men gripped their muskets
and peered and panted. Huzzah! But what’s the
cheering for? For General Scott! Here he stood,
as large as life, in his full uniform, gazing through
his glass up the hill, marking the progress of the
charge. He looked as cool and confident as if
watching a parade.</p>

<p>“Huzzah for Old Fuss and Feathers! Huzzah!
Huzzah!”</p>

<p>Company B passed close to him. He waved
encouragingly.</p>

<p>“On, my brave boys!” he said.</p>

<p>Next there were breastworks, bloodied and trampled.
The Mexicans had already been driven out of
these. Scrambling inside, Jerry almost stepped upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
a drum—a drum, drumsticks, cross-belt harness and
all. It was a Mexican drum, but differing little from
a United States outfit except the Mexican eagle instead
of the American eagle upon the brass plates.
So he grabbed it up quick, and lugging it on, trying
to sling it, he pursued the line.</p>

<p>The slope continued. A breeze was wafting away
the smoke; the stars and stripes and the regimental
flags of the stormers had advanced far; and the blue
ragged line, rushing, resting, and rushing again,
pressing after the streaming folds and after a single
figure, who, sword flashing, kept in the lead.</p>

<p>The drum bothered Jerry. When he had slipped
into the cross-belts they were so long that the drum
struck his shins, and the best that he could do was
to carry it in his arms. His own battle line had
forged well ahead of him; and when, dipping into a
hollow, and clambering up out, still following Company
B, he might glimpse the stormers again, he
heard a hearty burst of cheers and yells.</p>

<p>Huzzah! Huzzah! The hurrying First Division
was cheering—echoing the cheers from the top of the
hill. From the stone tower above a blue regimental
flag was flying—and the stars and stripes; the Mexican
flag had come down. The American soldiers
were springing upon the breastworks just beyond,
wielding their bayonets as they disappeared—other
American flags had been planted—the red caps of
the Mexican defenders surged backward, and eddying
and tossing broke into numerous rivulets flowing
tumultuously across the hill, to the south, for the
road below.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="X">X<br />
<small>JERRY JOINS THE RANKS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>El Telegrapho Hill—Cerro Gordo, the Big
Hill—had been taken. When Jerry, lugging his
precious drum, joined the Fourth Infantry the blue
coats were swarming over the flat top, taking prisoners,
and the Mexican rout was tearing down in the
south making for the Jalapa road.</p>

<p>From the northwest edge of the hill another
storming column had entered. This was the Second
Infantry and Fourth Artillery, under Colonel Bennet
Riley, of the Second Brigade, who had been ordered
to make a half circuit. But they had arrived too
late. Colonel Harney, the dragoon, and his Third and
Seventh Infantry and First Artillery had captured
the hill themselves. Those were the flags of the
Third, the Seventh and the First. The flag of the
Seventh had been raised first. Quartermaster-Sergeant
Henry, of the Seventh, had been the man who
had hauled down the Mexican flag from the flagpole
on the stone tower, and the Seventh’s color-bearers
had instantly raised their own standards.</p>

<p>The battle was won, but not all over. Colonel
Riley at once launched his column in pursuit of the
fleeing Mexicans. General Shields’ Volunteers—the
Third and Fourth Illinois and the New Yorkers—were
attacking in the west, to seize the batteries there
and cut in to the Jalapa road. Cannon were booming
in the south, where General Pillow’s Tennesseeans
and Pennsylvanians and a company of Fourth Kentuckians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
were being held at bay still. But the hill
of Cerro Gordo commanded all the country; it was
the key, and in the Mexican batteries around white
flags were being hoisted. Detachments were sent by
General Worth, who was senior officer here, to take
possession. The firing died away.</p>

<p>On the top of the hill all was excitement. The
dead and wounded were thick. The Rifles came up
from the ravine where they had checked a charge of
the Mexicans to turn Colonel Harney’s left; their
band was bringing a lot of prisoners, to the tune of
Yankee Doodle. The men of the storming columns
were loud in their praises of Colonel Harney. It
was he who had led, bare-headed and sword in hand.
The fifteen hundred of them had taken the hill, defended
by breastworks and the stone tower and
six thousand Mexican soldiers. Huzzah! Huzzah!
Huzzah!</p>

<p>And now here was General Scott, on his horse.
The men ran for him, the wounded crawled nearer
or feebly cheered; tears were flooding his grizzled
cheeks; he removed his hat, and his voice trembled.</p>

<p>“Brother soldiers! I am proud to call you
brothers, and your country will be proud to hear of
your conduct this day. Our victory has cost us the
lives of a number of brave men, but they died fighting
for their country. Soldiers, you have a claim on
my gratitude for your conduct this day which I will
never forget.”</p>

<p>He beckoned to Colonel Harney, and held out
his hand to him.</p>

<p>“Colonel Harney, I cannot now fully express my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
admiration of your gallant achievement, but at the
proper time I shall take great pleasure in thanking
you in proper terms.”</p>

<p>He put his chapeau back upon his grey head and
slowly rode on. Every few paces he halted to bend
and speak with the wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant was untouched; so were Captain
Gore and Lieutenant Smith; the Fourth Infantry,
and in fact, the whole of the First Division had
escaped all accident save by a few spent balls. It was
said that General Shields of the Volunteers had been
mortally wounded by a bullet through the chest—had
a hole in him the size of one’s fist! Major
Sumner of the Second Dragoons had been wounded.
Lieutenant Thomas Ewell of the Rifles, but serving
in the charge, had been the first officer to spring upon
the breastworks at the tower and had been shot down.
He and Colonel Harney and Quartermaster-Sergeant
Henry (who had hauled down the Mexican
flag there) were the heroes of the hour.</p>

<p>Santa Anna had fled, when he saw the hill being
taken. General Vasquez, of his infantry, was lying
dead here (a fine looking man, who had fallen shot
through the head, but his face to the foe); other
generals were surrendering—General Vega, who had
been fighting off the Pillow Volunteers, near the
river, had surrendered all his force. How many
Mexicans had been captured and what the losses
were on both sides nobody yet knew.</p>

<p>Hugging his drum and roaming over the battlefield,
Jerry met Hannibal. They shook hands
and danced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“What you got there, boy?”</p>

<p>“A drum. Found it on the way up.”</p>

<p>“Mexican drum, huh? Going to keep it?”</p>

<p>“Guess so. Can’t I?”</p>

<p>“Sure you can. You may get a chance to be a
drummer. We can fix it over. But hurrah! Didn’t
we do the business, though? Took the works just as
Fuss and Feathers said. Never a hitch. Pillow was
licked, at first, but that made no difference; nobody
expected him to do more than hold the enemy’s
attention. Twiggs and Riley’s brigade are cleaning
up the country west, and the dragoons are right on
Santa Anna’s heels. Now we won’t stop again till
we’re in the Halls of Montezuma. There’s the long
roll for the First. Good-by. We’re moving. Hang
on to that drum.”</p>

<p>The First Division had been directed to march for
the road and support the Riley brigade in pursuit of
the Mexicans. It was now mid-afternoon. Reports
came back that the dragoons were pressing hard
down the road, and that the Mexicans were too long-legged
for the infantry. Camp was ordered for the
night, just beyond the little village of Cerro Gordo,
in the pass.</p>

<p>General Santa Anna’s headquarters camp had
been here also. It and the village had been seized
by the Shields Volunteers and they were highly excited.
They had found Santa Anna’s carriage—a
large gilded coach, patterned after the State coach of
Napoleon Bonaparte. But General Santa Anna was
not in it. He had cut the team loose and had fled
upon one of the mules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>The Volunteers were passing a wooden leg
around; said that it was Santa Anna’s leg—</p>

<p>“No! His leg is cork.”</p>

<p>“Well, this may be his reserve leg, mayn’t it?
Next time we’ll capture the cork leg and then he can’t
run so fast.”</p>

<p>And a group of other Volunteers were having
a rough and tumble over something upon the ground.</p>

<p>It was a chest, burst open; a chest of Mexican
money for the expenses of Santa Anna’s army. The
military chest, that is. The soldiers were grabbing
at the money; officers were trying to separate them.
Suddenly all stood aside and saluted, for General
Scott was towering above, upon his horse.</p>

<p>“Let the boys have what is on the ground, officers,”
he said. “They’ve fought and worked all
day and deserve what they get. The remainder will
be placed in charge of the chief quartermaster.”</p>

<p>Pompey (Jerry had forgotten Pompey) arose
from the bottom of the heap, his black fists crammed
with bills. He certainly had arrived here very
quickly; no doubt had come in one of the wagons
sent forward to receive wounded.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. Sojerin’ is powerful hahd work fo’
mighty little pay,” he pronounced. “We-all near
captured Santy Annie. We done made him pore;
he’s gwine to beg his victuals, that’s shuah.” Pompey
saw Jerry and grinned. “Howdy, boy. Where
you been?”</p>

<p>“Climbing Telegraph Hill with the troops.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Pompey grunted. “Wha’ fo’ you go to
all dat work? I come ’round by the road an’ ketch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Santy Annie hyar. He run so fast he forgit his laig
an’ all his money. Jest slashed his mules from dat
coach an’ skadoodled. Where you find dat drum?”</p>

<p>“In some breastworks.”</p>

<p>“What you gwine to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Keep it.”</p>

<p>“’Spec’ you set big sto’ on bein’ a drummer.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder, Pompey.”</p>

<p>“Dis chile’s so rich now he can be a gin’ral,”
Pompey chuckled. “He don’t have to sojer common.
Yes, suh; Gin’ral Scott am a great strateegis’.”</p>

<p>The baggage train had not come in yet from Plan
del Rio, and the camp was only a plain bivouac of
blankets and haversack rations. Having little to do,
Jerry was cautiously trying out his drum, when
Lieutenant Grant spoke to him.</p>

<p>“You’ve won a drum, I see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Can you play it?”</p>

<p>“A little, is all; but I’m learning.”</p>

<p>“You want to be a drummer boy, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have a chance. One of the drummers
of the Fourth broke his leg on the way up the
hill. He got in front of a spent solid shot. You
might report to Drum Major Brown and see if he
can do anything for you. I hope,” the lieutenant
added, with a smile, “you can drum better than you
can cook or make a bed.”</p>

<p>“Hope so, too, lieutenant,” Jerry answered.
“Thank you, sir. Hooray!”</p>

<p>Tall Drum Major Brown of the Fourth looked
him over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“Lieutenant Grant sent you, eh? What can
you do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Jerry acknowledged. “I
can’t cook.”</p>

<p>“Looks like he’s found that out. Whenever a
man’s good at nothing he tries to join the band or the
field music. Humph! Where’d you get that drum?”</p>

<p>“On the way up the hill.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing there?”</p>

<p>“Just following along, sir, to keep with the lieutenant
and the company.”</p>

<p>“You’re the same young fellow who was in the
naval battery, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Can you drum?”</p>

<p>“Not much yet, but I’ll learn.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear you. Sound a roll.”</p>

<p>Jerry did, after a fashion.</p>

<p>“Tap common time.”</p>

<p>Jerry did.</p>

<p>“Now quick time.”</p>

<p>Jerry did.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a pretty good ear,” the drum major
approved. “I’m a drummer short. I’ll see what I
can do for you, but of course I’ll have to ask the
adjutant. Anyway, you can fall in with the field
music in the morning for the march. Are those
your best clothes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can rustle a uniform for you, and
have a tailor fit it.”</p>

<p>“Could I stay in Company B?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“That’s my company, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Is it! Well, as happens, the vacancy is
in Company C, and there you go unless Sykes of
Company B will exchange with you, and the company
officers don’t object.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Brown.” Jerry sped away to
find Hannibal and practice a few wrinkles. The two
worked a long time, shortening the cross-belts and
adapting the drum so that it would hang properly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI">XI<br />
<small>IN THE WAKE OF THE FLEEING ENEMY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>General Scott had lost three officers and sixty
rank and file killed, thirty officers and three hundred
and thirty-six men wounded, with one private missing.
The Mexican killed and wounded were over one
thousand; five generals and three thousand other
officers and men had been taken, together with four
or five thousand stands of small arms and forty-three
pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>The surgeons thought that General Shields might
get well; he had a fighting chance. Major Sumner
of the dragoons was going to travel in the Santa
Anna coach until he was strong enough to ride a
horse again.</p>

<p>The First Division was to push right onward,
following up the retreat of the eight thousand Mexicans
who had escaped. The main part of the Second
Division and the ill General Patterson, with a portion
of the Volunteers, were camped farther along, up the
road, but it was understood that the First would
soon have the honor of the advance, because its men
were fresh. And that was what the First desired:
to get ahead. It was tough to have missed out in
the battle of Cerro Gordo. Still, nothing could have
stopped old Colonel Harney, once he was started
up that hill.</p>

<p>Reveille had been ordered for four-thirty; and
when Musicians’ Call sounded for all the regimental
field music to assemble at the guard tent for roll-call,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Jerry boldly appeared to answer the drum-major’s
inspection. Not much of a figure he cut,
either, in his rags, and he had no little fun poked
at him; but he stuck and kept his place when the
drums and fifes formed at the head of the regiment
for the march.</p>

<p>It was a fine morning. General Scott had ridden
on, with an escort, to make his headquarters at
Jalapa, sixteen miles beyond the pass. The road
was all littered with the spoils of war. The fleeing
Mexicans had thrown away everything: guns and
overcoats and cartridge boxes, knapsacks and haversacks.
And soon worse signs of battle were to be
noted. Bodies of Mexican soldiers, cold and bloody,
became thicker and thicker. The dragoons had
spurred along here, hot in pursuit of the enemy.
The skulls of most of the dead men had been split
asunder by sabers. The bodies were mainly those
of Mexican lancers who had tried to cover the
retreat; but evidently the lancers had been no match
for the Second Dragoons led by Major Ben Beall, and
Captain Phil Kearny’s one company of the First.</p>

<p>The bodies lay in the road and upon both sides
all the way to Encerro, eight miles. The majority
of the dragoon horses had given out here; but from
Encerro (which was General Santa Anna’s country-place—or
one of several such places) to Jalapa there
were still a few bodies, for some of the dragoons
had kept on through the whole sixteen miles.</p>

<p>The road climbed. It was a paved road, broken
into holes by the rains. Beyond Encerro the country
grew much better. More mountains loomed before,
huge and blue. As the road wound upward, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
were green trees and lively streams that emptied
into an irrigating ditch skirting the road; and corn,
coffee, plantain and banana plantations with neat
white houses, instead of the cactus and brush and
bare ground and huts of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tierra caliente</i>—the
warm land of the lower yellow-fever district. It all
looked pretty good.</p>

<p>“We’ll not starve hereabouts, that’s sure,” remarked
the drummer who was plying his sticks on
Jerry’s left.</p>

<p>By the time, early evening, that Jalapa was in
sight the men were tired again, and Jerry’s fingers
were blistered with the drumsticks. Now the road
was lined on both sides with flowering shrubs and
vines, and the birds were singing loudly.</p>

<p>General Worth directed the adjutant to have
camp made on a piece of high ground near the road.
The drums beat the halt. The day’s up-hill march
had ended a short mile out of Jalapa.</p>

<p>After the guards had been posted and supper had
been eaten, everybody was glad enough to turn in.
Tattoo, to extinguish lights and be quiet, was
not needed.</p>

<p>When reveille sounded at daybreak, the drummers
and fifers saw a beautiful scene indeed. The
camp was above the clouds. Below, in the east or the
direction of Vera Cruz, a thunderstorm was raging;
the lightning darted through the clouds, which were
white on top with the rays of the unseen sun. Only
twenty-five miles in the south old Orizaba Peak
shone like silver. Jerry frequently had seen it from
Vera Cruz, but never had it appeared so wonderful.
And on before, in the west, there was Jalapa, located<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
between hills, with its white houses and red roofs set
amidst orchards and gardens.</p>

<p>“Well, now I say that like as not we all were
killed at Cerro Gordo and have arrived in Heaven,”
Drum Major Brown said.</p>

<p>“That’s right; for according to the Spanish,
they have a saying: ‘Jalapa is a small piece of Heaven
fallen to earth,’” a fifer asserted.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong there, and so are they,” corrected
somebody. “Look beyond. We’re going to be
nearer Heaven than when down at Jalapy.”</p>

<p>Back of Jalapa the real mountains began. They
rose straight up, it seemed, in a series of purple
masses until their crests touched the sky.</p>

<p>Halt was made at pretty Jalapa only long enough
for General Worth to receive fresh instructions
from General Scott; and out the First Division
marched, leaving the Second Division behind, and
the Patterson Volunteers, and most of the dragoons.
The First was in the advance at last.</p>

<p>Rumors stated that the First was to take the castle
of Perote, twenty-five miles on. Perote ranked second
in strength to only San Juan de Ulloa itself. But
if one brigade of the Second Division had been able to
take Cerro Gordo Hill, the two brigades of the First
felt able to take Perote.</p>

<p>The road climbed and climbed. The horses of
the Duncan flying battery of the Second Artillery,
and those of the wagon train, had all they could do,
even when helped by men at the wheels. But the day
was clear, and an inspiring sight that was to look
before and behind, and see the serried column winding
on, Captain Kearny’s Company K of the First<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
Dragoons ahead, General Worth and staff following;
the artillery afoot, and the infantry and their bands
trudging gallantly after, and the white-topped
wagons bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>“We’re surely bound to ‘see the elephant,’ as
the Volunteers say,” uttered Jerry’s neighbor, the
thin drummer.</p>

<p>That evening when bivouac was made they were
almost six thousand feet in air. The views had been
marvelous. Jerry hastened to find Hannibal, as
usual, for talk and practice. On the way he passed
Lieutenant Grant, who stopped him as he saluted.</p>

<p>“How do you like your new job by this time?”</p>

<p>“First rate, sir. I’ll learn, the drum major says.
Haven’t done so awfully bad, but of course they’re
easy on me. I don’t know much about the drills yet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder. You were thrown right into
things without previous instruction on that line.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Do you think we’ll have a fight on
the road, sir?”</p>

<p>“There’s a chance. If the pass beyond, called
La Joya, is held in force it may give us a little
trouble. But we can depend upon General Worth,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Guess <em>so</em>, sir. How’s Pompey, lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Pompey? That black rascal? Oh, Pompey lost
all his money the first night to those gambler camp
followers, and he’s down to plain cooking.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant stepped on; Jerry saluted again
and ran along.</p>

<p>“La Joya? Sure thing,” Hannibal said “It’s
like Cerro Gordo, and we’re the men to take it.”</p>

<p>The next day’s march was another stiff climb.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
Cherry trees and apple trees were giving place to
pines and firs. The soldiers puffed and complained
that their ears throbbed. It was slow work, toiling
up the long winding road. To-night there was
rain, which by morning had hardened to a heavy
white frost.</p>

<p>La Joya was not far now. The dragoons reconnoitred
ahead; the gunners of the Duncan battery
rode with slow matches lighted. Presently the road
was about to skirt the base of a round-topped hill.
The hill looked as though it had been fortified, but
when the Fourth marched by it was seen that the
breastworks had been abandoned.</p>

<p>Beyond La Joya the road continued through a
gorge two miles in length. No guns were fired, no
rocks were rolled, no Mexican flag was sighted.
The whole Mexican army had disappeared as if
broken by the defeat at Cerro Gordo. In fact, General
Scott had announced in his dispatches: “Mexico
no longer has an army.” But when camp was made
this evening, at a deserted village, the men began to
talk hopefully of Perote.</p>

<p>Perote, ten or twelve miles westward and down,
certainly would furnish a fight. It was a town and
a mountain and a fort, or castle. Everybody living
in Mexico knew of that famous castle, where prisoners
were confined in dungeons. And the mountain,
called the Chest of Perote, was the square black peak
seen from Vera Cruz. The town, upon a plain under
the mountain, had a church with a very tall tower,
visible for a great distance from several directions.</p>

<p>Jerry also banked on Perote, for he had been
promised his uniform there if the division stayed long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
enough to have it fitted. He needed the uniform.
His clothes were rather thin for use seven thousand
feet up in the mountains, and besides, what was a
drummer boy without a uniform? Luckily he had
gained a pair of shoes from the spoils captured at
Cerro Gordo; and at Perote he would be full rigged,
with sword, cap and all; and Dick Sykes, the drummer
of Company B, had agreed to exchange companies
with him.</p>

<p>General Worth was in a hurry. He moved the
division early in the morning. About noon they saw
Perote town, near at hand on the plain; and the
great castle, detached from it, guarding the road and
the Chest.</p>

<p>The column hastened, eager for action. The castle
remained grim and silent. General Worth sent
forward a staff officer to demand its surrender. The
Mexican flag fluttered down. The staff officer returned.
Perote had yielded.</p>

<p>General Worth established his headquarters in the
town, but the camp was ordered upon the plain, near
the castle, about a mile from the town. Colonel
Vasquez, of the Mexican army, had been left here by
General Santa Anna to turn the castle over to the
Americans—and that seemed odd, for it contained
fifty-four cannon (one of which had a bore of seventeen
inches across), eleven thousand balls, fourteen
thousand bombs and hand grenades, and five hundred
muskets. It covered two acres; and when the men
were permitted to inspect it they found that the walls
were eight feet thick and sixty feet high, surrounded
by a moat fifteen feet deep and seventy-five feet wide.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the castle sat by itself on the plains;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
and while it might have kept part of the army back
to capture it, the rest of the army could have marched
on. General Santa Anna probably had his reasons
for abandoning it; he of course would make a stand
somewhere else.</p>

<p>During the few days’ camp at Perote Jerry got
his uniform and equipment—regulation cap, sword
and buckles included—and felt privileged to strut
like a drummer boy indeed. Swapped companies
with Sykes, too. Took occasion to parade before
Pompey, who scoffed at him.</p>

<p>“Gwan, white boy. Who you? All stripes an’
no rank, dat what you be!”</p>

<p>The outfit had come to him only just in time. The
First Brigade was to march on by itself at once.
General Quitman had arrived at Jalapa from Vera
Cruz; the Second Brigade was to wait for him and
his detachment of Volunteers, while the First Brigade
pushed ahead to open the country farther.</p>

<p>It was said that General Worth had received instructions
from Old Fuss and Feathers to proceed
and seize the large city of Puebla, one hundred miles
westward and only ninety from the City of Mexico.
Puebla had sixty thousand people. Whether the
First Brigade was to do this nobody in the ranks
knew, but the men all were ready to try.</p>

<p>“If you fellows need help send back for us,” proffered
Hannibal, whose regiment, the Eighth, remained
to help hold Perote and to wait for the
Quitman Mohawks.</p>

<p>“We don’t figure on needing help, boy,” Jerry
retorted. “Next time I see you maybe it’ll be in the
Halls of Montezuma.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>The First Brigade set out gaily; General Worth
and staff; Company A, engineers, with Acting Captain
George W. Smith, Lieutenant J. C. Foster and
the sprightly Lieutenant McClellan; Light Battery A
and Companies B, C, D, F, G, H, I and K, Second
Artillery; Companies B, G and K, Third Artillery;
A, B, C, D, E and I, Fourth Infantry. They marched
up the National Road through fields of grain, around
the base of dark Pizarro Mountain (a lone peak
higher than Perote Peak), and had covered eighteen
miles when halt was made for the night at a homely
mud village.</p>

<p>The country again grew better, displaying fruit
orchards and green ranches. A fight was rather
expected at the pass of El Pinal, where the road
threaded a third narrow gorge in a range of bare,
granite hills; but although rocks had been heaped in
readiness to be rolled down upon the heads of any
enemy, nobody was here to roll them.</p>

<p>Beyond El Pinal the road issued upon a high,
flat ridge. The column suddenly forgot its weariness.
Another stately view unfolded. In the west
there uplifted two splendid mountains. The highest,
shining with snow, was the famous Popocatepetl, or
Smoky Mountain, three miles high. The other, its
comrade on the north of it, was—well, a jaw-breaker:
Iztaccihuatl. It, too, was a famous peak. The
two of them overlooked the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>And between the flat ridge and the range of the
two peaks there lay the beautiful green valley of
Puebla, dotted with the white-walled country-houses
of wealthy ranchers; and in the midst of the valley,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the roofs and spires of Puebla itself, twelve miles
distant from the ridge.</p>

<p>So the column quick-stepped manfully, and with
the fifes and drums pealing descended to the pretty
town of Amozoc, ten miles from the city of Puebla.</p>

<p>Amozoc proved to be a pleasant surprise. That
had been a long and hard march from Perote: with
the days warm and showery, and the nights cold and
frosty, and the men sleeping on the ground in the
dirt, without tents, and trudging by day through
mud and dust both. But here at Amozoc, the alcalde
or mayor met General Worth on the outskirts of the
town and invited him in, and when the column entered
the women came running from their adobe
houses, bringing fruit and pitchers of cold water.</p>

<p>“They call Puebla the City of the Angels, do
they? Faith, what’s the matter with Amozoc? Here
be rale angels.”</p>

<p>“The first white women we’ve seen since Jalapy.”</p>

<p>“Bless their purty faces an’ black eyes.”</p>

<p>Such were the comments by the ranks behind the
Fourth Infantry music.</p>

<p>An aide came galloping back to Colonel Garland.</p>

<p>“The general’s compliments, colonel, and he
directs that you quarter your infantry battalion in
the town corral, near the plaza. I will show you.”</p>

<p>Presently the Fourth had stacked arms in
the corral.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII<br />
<small>AN INTERRUPTED TOILET</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The orders were to clean up, as if for inspection
and parade. General Worth was sending word forward
to the city council of Puebla, giving notice
that he intended to occupy the city at once. Evidently
he wished to march in in style to make a
showing, for Puebla was the second largest city
in Mexico.</p>

<p>Jerry played in luck. He had kept his new uniform
in the best of shape. It would get shabby
soon enough, like the other uniforms. His drum
shone. So he was done with his prinking early.
The men generally were taking their time, to rest and
munch fruit. When he asked permission to go for
a stroll, Drum Major Brown said, having eyed him
and seen nothing wrong:</p>

<p>“All right. Report in thirty minutes.”</p>

<p>Tommy Jones, another smart drummer boy, from
Company I, joined him.</p>

<p>“What you lugging your drum for, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“So nobody’ll spatter mud on it, of course.”</p>

<p>“You’re a greenie yet,” Tom asserted. “When
you’ve carried a drum as long as I have you’ll be
mighty glad to drop it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I sha’n’t leave it, just the same. Some
of those fellows would put up a job on me to see how
much I’ll stand.”</p>

<p>Jerry continued, with his precious drum. The
mud-fenced corral was an odd sight as he and Tom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
hastened through to the gate. The men finally had
settled to work. They were in all stages of undress:
some of them were washing their faces and handkerchiefs
and shirts at the watering troughs, some were
shaving, some were sitting and polishing their jacket
buttons with their “buff sticks,” which held each button
in a slot while rag and powder were used; some
were shining their buckles, or whitening their cross-belts
with soap-stone, or cleaning their shoes; and
a number had their muskets apart and were scouring
the rust and dirt from locks, barrels and bayonets.</p>

<p>Pompey was hard at it on the outfits of Lieutenant
Smith and Lieutenant Grant.</p>

<p>“Where you gwine, stripes?” he demanded.
“’Peahs laike you drummers ain’t got nothin’ to do.
I shuah’d laike to jine the music. Jest tootle an’
thumpity-thump while we-all work. Where you
gwine now, so importinent? Mebbe Santy Anne
done sent fo’ you to s’render.”</p>

<p>“Mind you shine those buttons or you’ll get a
whaling,” Jerry answered. “I’ll be back to inspect.”</p>

<p>“You go ’long, stripes,” growled Pompey. “I
ain’t no sojer. I’se with the offercers. Who you, to
be so uppity? All stripes an’ no rank; that you!”</p>

<p>With Tom, Jerry hurried out.</p>

<p>“Pobrecitos! Aqui, pobrecitos—here, poor
little boys,” the kind-hearted women greeted, inviting
them to eat. But they had no time for that if they
wished to see the town.</p>

<p>Somehow, the people of Amozoc were overcordial
to an enemy. The North Americans were invading
their country—at Cerro Gordo probably had
killed Volunteers from this very place; and yet the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
citizens smiled and bowed as if to friends. It struck
Jerry as a game; he couldn’t put much stock in all
that palaver. He remembered the two Manuels.</p>

<p>The town was not anything great to look at. It
manufactured saddles and fine inlaid spurs, and the
best building was the principal church. The church
sat inside a fenced yard shaded by immense yew
trees covered with crimson-flowering vines—very
curious. Two or three officers were gazing about
and talking with the priests. The doors were open.
Taking off his cap Jerry sidled in; Tom followed.</p>

<p>“Dare you to climb that,” Tom challenged.</p>

<p>It was a ladder, seen through the doorway of a
closet in one corner, and extending almost straight up
into the belfry.</p>

<p>“Never take a dare. You watch me,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ll hold your drum.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t!”</p>

<p>Lugging the drum slung behind him, Jerry was
out of breath when he emerged into the dusty belfry,
beside the great copper bell. But he was glad that
he had come. What a view! He could see the road,
in the east, connecting with the plateau that they
had crossed from El Pinal; he could see the top
of Pizarro Peak at Perote; and he didn’t know but
that he could see the dust of the Second Brigade
and the Quitman Mohawks coming on one day’s
march late.</p>

<p>He crept around the bell, and could see the brigade
camp below. The men, like specks, were washing
up and mending clothes and whitening belts in the
corral and in the plaza where the artillery companies
had been quartered. He could see the specks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
pickets, posted at the edge of town. There in the
west were snowy Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, sentinels
over the Halls of Montezuma. And there, on
this side of them, was the city of Puebla of the
Angels, sparkling in the afternoon sun.</p>

<p>Then, as his eyes traveled, they lighted upon a
real dust cloud, slightly in the north, between Amozoc
and Puebla.</p>

<p>The cloud was advancing; yes, and rapidly.
Whew! Cavalry, sure as shooting. Mexican lancers!
No other horsemen could be expected from
that direction, not in such a mass. The outpost
guards had not seen them yet.</p>

<p>Like lightning Jerry twitched his drumsticks from
his belt, jerked his drum to the fore, and beat the
long roll. R-r-r-r-r-r-r! R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!
And R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r! The stunning
noise in the hollow belfry deafened him. It
must have fallen like a thunder clap upon the ears
of the camp. As he plied the drumsticks with his two
hands he saw that the grouped specks had frozen
stone still, as if staring about to locate the alarm.</p>

<p>He didn’t delay. Down he slid, down the
ladder, never caring how he landed—and he landed
plump into somebody’s arms. They were Lieutenant
McClellan’s.</p>

<p>“<a href="#i_frontis">You young rascal! What’s the meaning of this
racket?</a> Who authorized you to——?”</p>

<p>“The enemy, sir!” Jerry panted, not waiting.
“They’re coming.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I saw their dust——”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“Between here and Puebla—about five miles out—lancers,
sir.”</p>

<p>Away ran Lieutenant McClellan.</p>

<p>“Golly!” blurted Tom, who had been listening
with his mouth open. He, too, ran, and Jerry after.
They got to the corral just in time. All the town
had seemed to be excited, the pickets were firing
alarm shots, the long rolls were beating for artillery
and infantry, officers and men were hustling, and in
the corral the Fourth Infantry was falling in, helter
skelter, the soldiers wrestling into their trousers and
jackets and shoes, buckling on their belts and cartridge
boxes, seizing their muskets.</p>

<p>An aide spurred through the corral gate.</p>

<p>“Colonel Garland! Oh, Colonel Garland! The
general directs that you take four companies of the
Fourth, unite with the Second Artillery, and commanding
in person, march out upon the Puebla
road until in touch with the enemy or he has
been dispersed.”</p>

<p>Captain Nichols, the adjutant, rapidly called the
companies: A, B, E, I. Company B was into it!
Jerry sprang to his place. Drummer and fifer stuck
to their company on detached duty like this.</p>

<p>“Company B, by the right flank! Right face!
Company, forward—march!” Captain Gore bawled.</p>

<p>In double file (two ranks formation) Company A
marched out through the corral gate.</p>

<p>“By platoon, into line! Quick—march! Guide
right.”</p>

<p>The other companies were close before and behind.
The Second Artillery, serving as infantry,
was double-quicking from the plaza, under Major<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Galt. Two guns of Colonel Duncan’s battery issued
at a gallop. In the plaza the remaining two cannon
were being hauled at top speed to opposite corners to
face the streets.</p>

<p>At quick step the Colonel Garland detachment,
with the guns trundling at the rear, headed for the
Puebla road. And a funny spectacle the detachment
made: loose shoes flopping, jackets askew and half
buttoned, belts dangling, caps wrong side before,
muskets not all put together yet, and many of the
men only partly washed and shaved.</p>

<p>The cloud of dust was plain and much nearer.
The Mexicans appeared to be swinging around,
northward, as if bent upon cutting the road east of
Amozoc. They could be seen easily: a great column
of lancers—looked to be two or three thousand, all
at a trot, their yellow cloaks streaming, their red
jackets glimmering, their lance points, muskatoons
and trappings flashing.</p>

<p>“Form company! First platoon, right oblique!”</p>

<p>Then—</p>

<p>“Company, right turn—double quick—march!”</p>

<p>The detachment was marching straight for the
lancers; down came the lancers, massing for a charge.</p>

<p>“Column—halt!” Adjutant Nichols shouted.</p>

<p>“Form square—right and left into line—quick
march—wheel!”</p>

<p>With rumble and thud and cheer the two guns of
Flying Battery A dashed to the fore. They were
unlimbered and turned in a jiffy. The gunners
waved their slow matches, or linstocks, to brighten
the spark. The cannon were lined and pointed—an
instant more and with a gush and a boom a solid shot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
had whistled toward the gay lancers. Another—and
another. Whish! That was grape, and the
lancers scattered. One more dose of the murderous
grape and they had whirled, every man—they were
scouring like mad back for Puebla, a general (by his
epaulets) striving in vain to rally them. He was
carried along with the rest.</p>

<p>“Santa Anna! There goes Santa Anna!”</p>

<p>It was only a guess, but it proved true. Later
news said that General Santa Anna himself had gathered
cavalry, infantry and artillery at Puebla, in
order to stop the American advance; he had left the
infantry and artillery there, while with the lancers
he rode to cut off General Worth’s Second Brigade
from the First Brigade. In El Pinal Pass, for instance,
he might have done the job nicely. But he
had chosen the wrong time. A “rascal” of a drummer
boy had seen him from the church steeple.</p>

<p>After all it was not much of a brush. Colonel
Garland took his column into Amozoc again and arms
were stacked; but the day was drawing to a close
and there was no more prinking. The camp had to
keep on the alert, with strong guards out, for the
Mexicans might be up to more tricks.</p>

<p>In consequence of being half dirty and half clean
the men really looked worse than ever.</p>

<p>General Worth waited for the Colonel Clarke
brigade and the Quitman Volunteers to join him.
They arrived the next morning. General Quitman
brought only two regiments, the New Yorkers and
Second Pennsylvanians. The First Pennsylvania
(Colonel Wynkoop’s “Dutch” regiment) had been
left at Perote. As for the other Mohawks—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“Did you know that Old Fuss and Feathers
hasn’t more than six thousand men all told?” Hannibal
demanded, after first greetings.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“That’s right. We’ve lost five thousand Mohawks
since you left Perote. Got only the First and
Second Pennsylvania, the Palmettos and the New
Yorkers. The others were twelve-months men and
their time is out soon. The Alabamans and Georgians
are still at Vera Cruz; and at Jalapa General
Scott let the Third and Fourth Illinois and the Tennesseeans
and Kentuckians go. They said they’d stay
till the last day, but then they wouldn’t re-enlist; they
wanted to get home. So he thought they’d better
start right away, before the yellow fever got bad at
Vera Cruz. We’re garrisoning Jalapa and Perote,
and that’s all. Have a big sick list and a lot of
desertions, too, but not as many as in Texas and
northeast Mexico. Up there the Mexicans kept tolling
the men over by promising high pay and officers’
jobs. Some of ’em are fighting under Santa Anna
now, I bet, because they’re afraid to come back. If
they’re captured they’ll be shot or hanged.”</p>

<p>“Where’s General Scott?”</p>

<p>“He’s coming from Jalapa with the Second Division.
General Pillow’s gone to Vera Cruz to look
after reinforcements, and General Patterson has gone
home because he hasn’t men enough for a division. I
suppose Quitman or Pillow will command the Mohawks
now. So you fellows didn’t have much of
brush with those lancers, you say?”</p>

<p>“No. They ran off.”</p>

<p>“Well, you did your best, boy. You gave the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
alarm. I guess those smart officers will quit calling
us ‘rascally drummer boys.’ Anyhow, hope we
beat the Second Division into Puebla. There’s no use
in this whole division sitting here, only ten miles out.
We don’t need the Second.”</p>

<p>The restless General Worth decided the same
thing. The scouts who reconnoitred reported that
all Santa Anna’s forces in Puebla had vanished on
the road to the City of Mexico; the mayor of Puebla
sent the same word. Before noon the First Division
and the Quitman two regiments of Mohawks
marched for Puebla. The day was May 15.</p>

<p>A short distance out of Puebla the mayor and city
council met General Worth to escort him in. There
was to be no fight. The road changed to a magnificent
paved highway leading between pillars of shining
stone like colored marble.</p>

<p>“Close order—march!”</p>

<p>Those were the company orders. The ranks
closed up and the men took to the cadenced step,
all feet moving to the taps of the drums.</p>

<p>“Column, close in mass—quick—march!”</p>

<p>Each company closed in upon the company before,
so that there was a solid column of platoons,
every musket at a right shoulder shift, every foot
planted in unison with the other feet.</p>

<p>“Guide—right!”</p>

<p>This did not prevent the men from glancing aside,
as they marched shoulder to shoulder. The tune for
the fifes and drums was Yankee Doodle but the regimental
bands played Washington’s March.</p>

<p>The paved road led through a broad gateway in
the city wall. The top of the wall had been crowded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
with Pueblans, and now the streets were lined with
more, and the balconies of the buildings were fringed
with men and women gaily dressed, peering over to
see the North Americans. The women waved their
handkerchiefs and fans, the men flashed white teeth
while they puffed their cigarettes and made remarks.</p>

<p>It was a pity that the toilet at Amozoc had been
interrupted. Many of the muskets were still stained
from the battle of Cerro Gordo and the rains; some of
the rank and file had not had time to shave. Uniforms
were dingy, belts half whitened or whitened
not at all, the buttons and buckles and the band instruments
were tarnished. Yes, and faces were not
especially clean, for the grime of the marches through
dust and mud was deep. Besides, a number of the
soldiers had been ill.</p>

<p>It was evident that the Pueblans were disappointed.
They had expected to see glitter and show
as in their own troops, instead of this collection of
thin, long-haired, shabbily clad troops marching
under rain-stained, wind-torn flags.</p>

<p>But no troops in the world could have marched
with better discipline. This was a veteran division,
even the Mohawks. Those holes in the flags were
bullet holes, the stains were powder stains. Cerro
Gordo was behind, so was Perote, here was Puebla,
and the next entry would be that into the City
of Mexico.</p>

<p>Halt was made in the large plaza, in the very
center of the city, bordered on one side by the great
palace or governor’s house, six hundred feet long,
and on another by the cathedral, covering a block.
The Pueblans surrounded the plaza in dense ranks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
staring and commenting. General Worth showed
not the slightest hesitation. The division stacked
arms here, cannon were placed at the corners, guards
were posted, and the companies dismissed. It was a
pleasant spot. The men comfortably stretched out.
They were only three thousand Americans in the
midst of sixty thousand Mexicans, with the whole
Mexican army somewhere about; but in a few minutes
two-thirds of them were sound asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIII">XIII<br />
<small>GETTING READY AT PUEBLA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“The ‘old man’ ’s coming!”</p>

<p>It was now May 27. The First Division and the
Quitman Volunteers had been holding Puebla for
more than a week and a half. There had been alarms.
One day all the troops had stood under arms, from
morning until night, with guns loaded and with three
days’ rations in their haversacks, expecting an attack
by Santa Anna; but Santa Anna had not appeared.
General Worth seemed nervous—and little wonder.</p>

<p>Word had arrived at last from General Scott
that he would be here to-morrow at noon. This was
his custom: to send a warning ahead whenever he
rode up the line, so that the regiments might be ready
to turn out and receive him in proper style.</p>

<p>The Eighth Regiment (General Worth’s “own”)
was selected to do the honors. This peeved Hannibal,
but it let Jerry and the Fourth out to see things
as they occurred. Luckily, the Fourth was quartered
near the east gateway of the National Road from
Vera Cruz and Jalapa, and a fellow could climb the
wall here and look right down upon the road.</p>

<p>First, about half-past eleven, General Worth and
General Quitman with their staffs, a-glitter in their
full-dress uniforms of blue cloth and gold trappings,
white plumes floating from their chapeaus, went
trotting to meet the chief.</p>

<p>All came back together: General Scott, tall and
massive, upon his prancing horse, in full uniform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
complete from his plume to his shining boots; General
Worth on his right, General Quitman on his left,
the staffs following; Captain Phil Kearny’s company
of the First Dragoons and a detachment of the
Second Dragoons in column of fours as escort. With
only these two hundred and fifty dragoons General
Scott had ridden ahead of the Twiggs division, clear
from La Joya, one hundred and twenty miles.</p>

<p>The soldiers upon the wall at either side of the
gate gave Fuss and Feathers a rousing cheer. That
pleased him. He took off his chapeau and bowed
right and left to his “boys.”</p>

<p>Commander-in-chief’s headquarters were to be at
the palace on the plaza. On the way to it there was
a square of trees, the Alameda. The Eighth Infantry
had been drawn up on parade, in two ranks, in
front of the church San José, opposite the Alameda.
Colonel Clarke himself, of the Second
Brigade, commanded.</p>

<p>“Present—arms!”</p>

<p>The drums beat a roll, every musket came to a
rigid present, every sword to a salute, the colors
dipped, and General Scott, looking like the old hero
that he was, rode proudly along the line, his hand at
his hat, his eyes a little misty. The regimental band
played “Hail to the Chief.”</p>

<p>The Second Division of Regulars did not get in
for a couple of days. General Childs, of the Third
Artillery, had been left at Jalapa with about one thousand
men, mainly Regulars of all the arms. Colonel
Wynkoop and most of his First Pennsylvanians
were still at Perote. Having only five thousand eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
hundred active troops, General Scott was obliged to
mark time at Puebla while awaiting reinforcements.</p>

<p>This was hard, for it gave General Santa Anna
plenty of leisure in which to gather another army
and complete his fortifications. And while Puebla
was a pleasant place, there seemed to be a discouraging
amount of sickness caused by the fruits and the
water. One-fourth of the soldiers were in the hospital
and many died.</p>

<p>The well were kept busy, for General Scott believed
in exercise and drill. The army had its first
opportunity since leaving Vera Cruz to drill together.
Every day one or another of the brigades was
manœuvred out upon the Puebla military drill
grounds near the city walls; and three times a week
there was a full division review, under the eyes of the
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>The Pueblans always crowded to witness the
drills, and after watching they were free to admit
that the Americans knew how to soldier.</p>

<p>It was no slouch of a job to be a drummer, as
Jerry found out all over again. He himself had a lot
to learn, if he would obey the drum major’s signals
made with the tasseled staff. The drummer’s especial
drill, for instance: Put up—drumsticks! Unsling—drums!
Ground—drums! Take up—drums! Suspend—drums!
Draw out—drumsticks! The marching
signals: By the right flank, by the left flank, wheel
to change direction, right oblique, left oblique, and
so forth. The beats: The marching taps, ninety steps
to the minute; the flam, or double beat, in pairs, at
one hundred and ten steps to the minute, used in
the evening retreat; the rolls, eighty beats to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
minute for the troop call, and one hundred and ten
to the minute for quick time and the salutes; the
drag, one hundred and forty beats to the minute,
for double-quick time, and the long roll, in sections as
fast as one could work the drumsticks, for alarms.</p>

<p>Then there were the many calls: The general, for
the whole camp to prepare to break up; the assembly,
for the companies to fall in; to the color, for the companies
to form regiments; the reveille, or first call, in
the early morning, to wake the camp up; the tattoo, or
last call, in the evening, to send the camp to bed;
the drummers’ call, or musicians’ call; come for
orders, and the call to the sergeants or corporals;
the retreat call, for evening parade; and in the field
the halt, the recall, the march in retreat, the run or
charge, and the commence firing.</p>

<p>A drummer boy had to have a good ear and lots
of constant practice to do all these things, with
the drum major or some of the veteran drummers
criticizing.</p>

<p>There were one drummer and one fifer in each
company of infantry and artillery, although the battery
sections usually had a bugler. The dragoons
had trumpeters. Drummers and fifers of each regiment
formed the field music and marched with the
band, when the regiment had a band. The Fourth
did not have a band, which was lucky. The Eighth
had theirs, and Hannibal claimed that it was a nuisance,
always getting in the way of the field music.</p>

<p>The music was under the drum major. He acted
as first sergeant and received his orders from the
regimental adjutant. He called the roll at music
assembly, gave the signals with his staff, and saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
that the musicians knew how to play. If there was
any instrument, from the drum even to the horn,
that “Old Brown,” the drum major of the Fourth,
could not play, nobody had yet discovered it.</p>

<p>In regimental camp and manœuvres all the company
drummers and fifers generally played and
marched together—say ten drummers and ten fifers.
They assembled at the guard house for reveille, and
beating and tooting paraded around through the
camp, paying especial attention to the officers’ quarters!
The regimental calls were preceded by the
regimental march to draw attention, in case that
more than the one regiment was present. When
marching in column, the field music was at the head
of the regiment, the drummers behind the fifers.
But the drummer and fifer of each company messed
and camped with the company, and stayed with it
when it was detached.</p>

<p>The drummers served each in turn at being posted
at the guard house to march with the guard on tour
and relief and to sound any signal that might be
required. The drummers, too, were used as markers
in the drills to indicate where the lines were to be
formed and dressed; and might be summoned for
orderlies or messengers.</p>

<p>In fact, a drummer was an important personage.
The drummer boys got the pay and rations of a private;
wore a better uniform and a short sword.</p>

<p>But not all the drummers were boys. There was
a sprinkling of boys and a sprinkling of grown men;
and when the field music had formed it made rather a
funny sight with a six-foot lath like Bill Sykes in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
same short rank with a dumpy, strutty little “rascal”
like young Tommy Jones, aged only fourteen.</p>

<p>The fifers were mainly men. Jerry’s partner,
Fifer O’Toole, outreached him by a foot.</p>

<p>At rest intervals the troops were now given
chances to see the city and nearby country. Puebla
far surpassed Vera Cruz. The saying ran: “Puebla
is the first heaven, Mexico (the City of Mexico) is
the second.” The paved streets were many and
broad, flanked by splendid stone buildings and traversed
by the rattling coaches of the wealthy. There
were one hundred churches, and innumerable fine
stores; the markets teemed with fruits and vegetables.
The houses were thrown open to the officers
and men; General Worth had started in by not interfering
with the city government as long as it did
not interfere with him; General Scott continued the
system. He permitted the city watchmen to patrol
with their arms as before, so that at night there were
two sets of guards.</p>

<p>The Mexican watchmen would chant:</p>

<p>“Ave Maria! Son las doce de la noche, y
sereno,” which meant: “Hail, Mary! It is eleven
o’clock and quiet.”</p>

<p>While the American sentries growled:</p>

<p>“Post Number One (or Two, or Three). All’s
well.”</p>

<p>Six miles out from the city were the ruins of the
ancient Aztec Indian town of Cholula, with a pyramid
of clay and stone blocks two hundred feet high,
mounted by one hundred and forty steps. When
Cortez, the conquerer, came through here in 1520
the pyramid was used for human sacrifices, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
never-dying fire to the Aztec gods was kept alive on
top by the priests. But Cortez destroyed the city and
killed six thousand of the people. Now there was
no city, and no fire, and on top of the pyramid a
church had been erected.</p>

<p>This was such a historic place that the troops were
marched out to it, a brigade at a time, for an excursion.
The Fourth Infantry with the First Brigade
of the First Division, under General Worth and
Colonel Garland, made the trip, one clear day, when
old Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl seemed to be within
musket shot instead of seventy-five miles away. Beyond
those two mountains lay the City of Mexico,
the goal.</p>

<p>“We are the ones to get there,” thought Jerry.
The Regulars themselves were no discouraging sight—fifteen
hundred well-trained soldiers marching at
ease, bearing their veteran flags; the artillery officers
brilliant in red trappings, the infantry marked
by white, and the general staff gold-braided and
gold-epauletted.</p>

<p>To be sure, whenever the troops started for anywhere
spies in Puebla immediately galloped into the
country to carry the news to Mexican lancers. But
who feared the lancers?</p>

<p>General Scott came from behind. He and his
staff swept along the column of platoons, and slackened
to ride abreast half way.</p>

<p>The officers there had been discussing the scenery.
Some gave the palm to glistening Popocatepetl, some
to Iztaccihuatl, some to the red-roofed city, some
to the fields of green, and some to the great pyramid
surmounted by the church. But General Scott said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
in his loud voice, so that the drummers and fifers
of the Fourth heard plainly:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I differ with you all. My greatest
delight is in this fine body of troops, without whom
we can never sleep in the Halls of Montezuma, or in
our own homes again.”</p>

<p>The speech traveled up and down the column and
everybody cheered. Old Fuss and Feathers certainly
appreciated good soldiers.</p>

<p>It had been hoped that the army would “sleep in
the Halls of Montezuma” on July 4. But although
plenty of provisions had been collected the reinforcements
were still slow. So the Fourth of July was
passed at Puebla, with celebrations by the rank and
file, and in the evening a grand reception by General
Scott at the palace for officers and townspeople.</p>

<p>Then, on July 8, General Pillow, who had been
promoted to a major-generalcy in the Regulars,
arrived from Vera Cruz with forty-five hundred men,
under Colonel McIntosh of the Fifth Infantry and
General George Cadwalader, a new brigadier, of
Pennsylvania. They had started in three detachments
and had had several skirmishes with guerillas
on the way; had lost fifty men in killed and wounded,
and a great deal of baggage.</p>

<p>They brought up the Palmettos, the Mounted
Rifles, some of the Second and new Third Dragoons,
Company F of the Fourth Infantry, B of the Fifth
Infantry, parts of the Ninth, Eleventh and Fifteenth
Infantry (new Regular regiments), a few companies
of Voltigeurs or scouting riflemen, and a batch of
recruits for all arms.</p>

<p>General Franklin Pierce (another new brigadier),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
of New Hampshire, arrived next, on August 6, with
twenty-four hundred men out of three thousand.
He had dropped six hundred by reason of sicknesses,
and had had six fights. His troops were the famous
Marine Corps of the navy, the remainder of the new
Regular regiments—Ninth, Eleventh, Twelfth,
Fourteenth and Fifteenth—and more recruits.</p>

<p>The new regiments were rather raw yet; had
been mustered in only a few months, and only six
out of the four hundred officers had seen service.
The others were civilian appointees—many were
greener than Jerry. They made an odd sight as they
rode or walked about trying to act like old hands, but
bothered by their swords and spurs. The Marines,
however, were a snappy lot, officers and all, and took
no back talk from anybody.</p>

<p>General Scott had called in the garrison from
Jalapa. It looked as though he was almost ready to
march on. He now commanded fourteen thousand
men in Puebla, but the sick list was tremendous. Two
thousand men were in the hospital, five hundred
others were just getting well. Nevertheless, the time
had come. For several days before the arrival of the
last reinforcements under General Pierce all signs
had pointed to an early break up. A council of war
had been held at headquarters, attended by Generals
Worth, Twiggs, Quitman and Pillow; aides and
orderlies had been racing through the streets, equipments
had been overhauled and wagons loaded.</p>

<p>Reports said that General Santa Anna had gathered
an army again of thirty thousand and more,
and had fortified all the approaches to the capital.</p>

<p>That made no difference to the army. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
Regulars were eager to start. The Volunteers—the
Second Pennsylvanians, the New Yorkers and the
South Carolinans—gallantly proclaimed that they
wished to “see the elephant” beyond those next
mountains. These fighting Mohawks were bound to
go through, and compared with the new Regulars,
they were veterans.</p>

<p>Colonel Childs, from Jalapa, was to remain in
Puebla with the sick and a garrison of five hundred.
The majority of the First Pennsylvanians stayed at
Perote to hold that. Counting out teamsters and the
like General Scott had, after all, only about ten
thousand seven hundred officers and men, with
whom to advance against General Santa Anna’s
thirty thousand.</p>

<p>“We might better have chased right along with
what we had after the battle of Cerro Gordo, and
reached Mexico as soon as Santa Anna,” Hannibal
complained. “He’s had time to make ready for us,
and we’re cut loose from our base—haven’t men
enough to garrison a single place, except Perote, between
here and Vera Cruz, and the whole road is
worried by guerillas. Old Fuss and Feathers says
he’s thrown away the scabbard and is advancing with
the naked sword. It’s do or die. Well, anyhow, the
Second Division starts to-morrow. Those fellows
have the luck again. Hope we aren’t far behind.”</p>

<p>This was August 6, the day of General Pierce’s
arrival. The army had been re-apportioned into
four divisions instead of three.</p>

<p>The First Division was about the same as before:
Second Artillery, Third Artillery, Fourth Infantry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
in the First Brigade; Fifth Infantry, Sixth Infantry,
Eighth Infantry, in the Second Brigade.</p>

<p>The Second Division (General Twiggs’) was
about the same also: First Artillery, Third Infantry,
and the Rifles, in the First Brigade; Fourth Artillery,
Second Infantry, Seventh Infantry, with the Engineer
company and Ordnance company, in the Second
Brigade.</p>

<p>Major-General Pillow, who ranked next to General
Scott, now, as full major-general, commanded
the Third Regular Division. This contained the new
regiments. The First Brigade, General Cadwalader,
had the Voltigeurs or light riflemen, the Eleventh
Infantry, the Fourteenth Infantry, and Captain John
Magruder’s Light Battery I of the First Artillery.
The Second Brigade, under the handsome General
Franklin Pierce, had the Ninth, Twelfth and Fifteenth
Infantry.</p>

<p>General Quitman commanded the Fourth Division.
This was the Volunteers and the Marines.
General Shields, who had recovered from his terrible
wound received at Cerro Gordo, had, of course, been
given the Volunteer brigade, composed of the Palmettos
under Colonel P. M. Butler, and the Second
New Yorkers under Colonel Ward B. Burnett. Lieutenant-Colonel
E. S. Watson, of the Marines, had
the Second Brigade—the Marines under Major Levi
Twiggs and the Second Pennsylvania (a fine regiment
equal to the Regulars) under Colonel W. B.
Roberts, with Light Battery H of the Third Artillery
under Lieutenant E. J. Steptoe, and Company C,
Third Dragoons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>Then there was the cavalry brigade, commanded
by the fire-eater, Colonel Harney, and containing
Company F of the First Dragoons, under Captain
Phil Kearny, nephew of General Stephen W. Kearny
who had marched the First to California; six companies
of the Second Dragoons, under Major E. V.
Sumner, who also had recovered from his Cerro
Gordo wound; and three companies of the new
Third Dragoons, under Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas
P. Moore.</p>

<p>The Twiggs Second Division was to lead the way,
with Harney’s dragoons clearing the advance.</p>

<p>Everybody turned out early the next morning,
Tuesday, August 7, to see the Second start for the
Halls of Montezuma. The dragoons were already
a short distance upon the road. A great throng of
soldiers, sick and well, and of the townspeople,
pressed around the plaza where General Twiggs
drew up his regiments on parade before the government
palace to be inspected by General Scott.</p>

<p>Inspection over with, he faced the long lines and
raised his hat—and what a burly fighter he looked
to be, with his short neck and his sunburned red face
and his mane of white hair.</p>

<p>“Now, my lads, give them a Cerro Gordo
shout!” he bellowed. “One, two, three—huzzah!”</p>

<p>“Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!” The twenty-five
hundred cheered with one voice in a deafening
burst. Jerry, Hannibal, and every comrade in the
crowd joined wildly. The bands blared, the drums
rolled, the fifes squeaked.</p>

<p>“By company, right wheel! Quick—march!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>The division broke into column of companies.</p>

<p>“Columns, forward—march! Guide—right!”</p>

<p>“Break into platoons—march!”</p>

<p>Away tramped the Second Division, bands playing,
drums beating, cannon rumbling, flags flying.</p>

<p>“Hi!” Pompey chuckled, having squirmed up
beside Jerry and Hannibal. “Santy Annie, he done
heah dat shout, an’ he’s a-sayin’: ‘Dem Yankees is
comin’! Now where I gwine?’”</p>

<small>A SIGHT OF THE GOAL AT LAST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The next morning the General Quitman Mohawks
and Marines marched jauntily out, headed
by Captain Gaither’s company of the Third Dragoons.
The Worth division was to leave on the
morning following; the Pillow Third Regular Division
would be the last.</p>

<p>All Puebla gathered to see the First go. Not
a few of the Mexican women were crying. The
First Division was the favorite. The townspeople
had named it the “Pueblan Division.” They admired
the way the men had stacked arms and coolly
lain down to sleep in the plaza as if fearing nothing.</p>

<p>General Worth, dark and flashing-eyed, sitting
his horse like a field marshal, called for three cheers.</p>

<p>“Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!”</p>

<p>In column of sections five men wide the First
passed through the gate, and upon the National
Road to the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>“Form platoons—march!”</p>

<p>“Route step—march!”</p>

<p>From close order of thirteen inches distance
the ranks fell back to twenty-eight inches, or one
pace, apart. The men might carry their guns at
will, always with the muzzles up; they need not keep
step and might talk.</p>

<p>An aide from the general staff galloped in from
behind and said something to General Worth. The
order rang imperative:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>“Column, close order—march!”</p>

<p>So everybody came to a shoulder arms, the ranks
closed, the drums again tapped the cadence of ninety
steps to the minute.</p>

<p>General Scott hastened by with his staff and
escort, and continued on to join the Twiggs advance,
it was said.</p>

<p>“Route step—march!”</p>

<p>The day, August 9, was sunny and warm. The
City of Mexico lay about ninety miles west, beyond
the next range of mountains. From the pass over
the range the Valley of Mexico and the city would
be seen.</p>

<p>At the end of the third day’s march camp was
pitched amidst an icy drizzle, in a high valley named
the Rio Frio or Cold Water Valley. There had
been a stiff climb through pine forests but the pass
was near before. General Worth, riding his horse
among the regiments, directed that timber be cut
by the messes and fires built. Soon the dark rainy
valley was aglow with the log blazes of the First
Division bivouac, here ten thousand feet up, in the
Anahuac Mountains.</p>

<p>Jerry was warm and comfortable, rolled in his
blanket beside the fire, his drum stowed in its oilcloth
housing.</p>

<p>“Ah, weel, I’ve seen worse in Scotland,” Private
“Scotty” MacPheel remarked.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ll niver mind whin we’re all a-livin’
cosy-loike in the Halls o’ Montezumy,” said Corporal
Finerty. “Faith, an’ they’re not fur now.
Jist over the top o’ the hill, an’ down.”</p>

<p>The fires gradually died under the pelting rain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
When to the touch of a sergeant, Jerry awoke, shivering,
for reveille, his blanket was sheeted with ice,
and icicles hung from his drum cover.</p>

<p>But this day they all were to cross the range and
would see the City of Mexico below, where General
Santa Anna waited with his thirty thousand men, his
artillery and his forts.</p>

<p>To drum beat and fife note, playing the regimental
marches, the First Division stepped out briskly in
the crisp air. The way was up, and up, and up.
At every half mile the column had to stop and rest.
The men sweat under their muskets, knapsacks,
haversacks, cartridge boxes and blanket rolls. When
they reached the top they were almost eleven thousand
feet aloft.</p>

<p>The pass formed a plateau about a mile long but
not wide. At noon the column halted at the western
edge for dinner.</p>

<p>Nothing below could be seen except a heavy fog
extending like billows of cloud, while up here the
sun was shining. Nevertheless the Valley of Mexico
was underneath the fog bank.</p>

<p>“Companies, fall in!”</p>

<p>“By platoons, forward—route step—march!”</p>

<p>Down they went upon a pretty fair road. The
fog was breaking, as they twisted and turned amidst
the pines. Now the sun commenced to shine into
the valley itself. Lakes glistened, green fields unfolded,
more mountains appeared.</p>

<p>With rumble of wheels, tramp of feet and clatter
of hoofs the First Division descended. Nobody
could deny that the long column of cavalry, artillery,
infantry and wagons made a handsome sight. General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Worth and staff, in their great-coats, upon their
horses, had paused. The general was eagerly surveying
the line. Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen! Look at that! Just look at that
column! Isn’t it enough to cheer the heart of
any man?”</p>

<p>By mid-afternoon the whole valley was in view.
There were numerous towns; several large lakes; the
City of Mexico was disclosed as a patch of sparkling
towers and turrets, thirty miles distant. And after
a time the ranks began to pick out the camps of the
Second and Fourth Divisions, blue with soldiers and
slightly marked by the few tents of officers.</p>

<p>“That first is Twiggs.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s Quitman. I can see the Mohawks
’atin’!”</p>

<p>“B’gorry, ’tis Twiggs; for there’s Ould Fuss an’
Feathers, big as anny thray men!”</p>

<p>“Column, close up—march!”</p>

<p>The ranks closed, the men fell into the cadenced
step. Drum Major Brown ordered “Coming
Through the Rye”; and with the fifes and drums
of the Fourth Regiment playing “If a body meet a
body,” and the other music and the bands playing
what they chose, they all marched past the first camp
(that of the Quitman Volunteers and Marines); before
reaching the camp of the Second they turned
into a road branching off to the southwest, as if for
a round shining lake; and at sunset, while the clouds
promised rain, they made camp at a village named
Chalco, near the eastern border of the lake.</p>

<p>The evening was rainy. Under orders from the
officers the company sergeants soon billeted the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
in the village houses and shacks. Jerry’s mess—First
Sergeant Mulligan, Corporal Finerty, Fifer
O’Toole, Privates “Scotty” MacPheel, John Doane
(who had served in the British army) and Henry
Brewer from New Jersey—got quarters equal to
the best: the same being a room with stout clay walls
and mud roof, and a fireplace, and sheep pelts on the
dirt floor for softness. To be sure, the pelts smelled
rather strong when warmed up, but what difference?</p>

<p>Sergeant Mulligan sent out Scotty and Henry
to forage, with Jerry as interpreter. They three
came back bringing a shoulder of mutton, two
chickens and an armful of corn. Under orders from
the sergeant, in a gruff voice, but delivered by Jerry,
the Mexican who owned the hut supplied firewood.
Speedily the mess was cooking and eating.</p>

<p>“The only thing that bothers me now is, jest how
are we goin’ to call on Santy Annie?” said Fifer
O’Toole, munching; “for, as I understand, all the
roads leadin’ in to him are dikes, like, through
the bogs, wid wather on both hands an’ cannon
overhead.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you l’ave that to Gin’ral Scott?”
Corporal Finerty reproved. “Faith, he’ll find the
way in an’ we’ll take it. Meself, I ain’t paid to do
a gin’ral’s work; I’ve my own business, an’ that’s
fightin’ whin the officers give the word. They’re
the lads who know.”</p>

<p>“By the way the folks in this town are acting,
keeping so aloof and not over friendly, they consider
us as good as licked already,” put in Henry Brewer.
“‘You are all dead men’—wasn’t that the comforting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
word from the black-faced villain who handed us
over the mutton?” he appealed to Jerry.</p>

<p>Jerry nodded.</p>

<p>“But they said the same about you in Vera
Cruz,” he added.</p>

<p>“Yis, an’ they thought the same at Cerry Gordo,”
Sergeant Mulligan asserted. “An’ the same they
thought in Pueblo, whin the purty gurls cried to see
us set out. But for all that we’re still terrible able to
punish flesh-an’-blood victuals. Wid full stomicks
an’ Scott to lade us on we go.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XV">XV<br />
<small>OUTGUESSING GENERAL SANTA ANNA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In the morning the clouds had vanished. The
day was as warm as midsummer; in the east and
southeast the great peaks of Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepetl
stood out white and sharp and clear; large
Lake Chalco shimmered in lanes of water through
reeds and floating meadows; across it, and farther in
the northwest, the City of Mexico appeared plainly,
its towers and high roofs glistening in the sun.</p>

<p>Everything looked peaceful. After the camp
had performed its fatigue duties, the men were set
at work cleaning their equipment. Jerry finished
early and was free to wander.</p>

<p>By all talk throughout the regiment the situation
was serious. The City of Mexico was in sight, but
it was surrounded by lakes and bogs, and batteries
of heavy guns, and fortifications manned by thirty
thousand or more Mexican soldiers.</p>

<p>After a while he espied an officer seated by himself,
apart, upon a pile of old clay bricks and studying
a map. It was Lieutenant Grant, busy figuring the
problem. Jerry went to him and saluted.</p>

<p>“Well, my lad?” the lieutenant invited.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, sir, but I was wondering
what we’re going to do,” Jerry ventured.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant smiled.</p>

<p>“So are the rest of us. It’s a very pretty puzzle.
But General Scott will solve it, for here we are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll take the city, of course, sir,” Jerry
agreed. “I don’t know how, though.”</p>

<p>“N-no,” the lieutenant mused, eying his map.
Then he eyed Jerry. He was worn and thin, like
the soldiers generally. “You’re a bright boy.
Maybe if you look at this map you will understand
things better. But this is all confidential, you must
remember. The man in the ranks is supposed to
wait and obey orders; the field officers say what they
are. And as I’m only a second lieutenant I have little
to do with the planning of operations.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember, sir,” Jerry promised.</p>

<p>“All right. Sit down. Here’s a sketch map that
I’ve borrowed from the engineers. It covers this
section. There’s the road from Puebla, over which
we advanced. There’s the Fourth Division camp, at
Buena Vista, which we passed before turning off; and
there’s the Second Division camp at Ayotla, three
miles along toward the city. Here we are at Chalco,
a short distance south of the Puebla road and the
two other camps, and there in the northwest is the
City of Mexico. You’ll see how we are blocked off
from going over the Puebla or National road, by
the fortress of El Peñon. There’s El Peñon, thirteen
miles west of General Twiggs’ camp, on the
main highway.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_194map">
  <img src="images/i_194map.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><i>The Campaign in the Valley of Mexico</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Yes, sir. I see it. Can’t we take it like we
took Cerro Gordo?”</p>

<p>“General Scott, I have been informed, would
rather not try. El Peñon is stronger than Cerro
Gordo was. You can see it from here. It consists
of one steep hill; mounts fifty-one guns by batteries
placed in terraces, and is surrounded by a ditch of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
water twenty-four feet wide and ten feet deep. The
guns enfilade, or rake the length of the road for
a long distance, and we cannot avoid them by leaving
the road on account of marshes on either hand.
To force El Peñon would cost three thousand men,
and we would still be upon a narrow road, seven
miles from the city, and unable to manœuvre. But
southwest of El Peñon, and nearer the city, on a
branch road or cut-off from the main road, you see
another fortress called Mexicalcingo.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Mexicalcingo is a fortified town, commanding
the passage of a bridge through the marsh at the
head of Lake Xochimilco, which is the lake extending
into the northwest from Lake Chalco. Mexicalcingo
is scarcely five miles from the City of Mexico,
but otherwise it gives much the same problem as
El Peñon. We might carry the batteries and the
bridge, and then we’d still be on a narrow road,
flanked by marshes for four miles, before we struck
another main road to the city. General Scott is having
both fortifications reconnoitred, I believe, but
his spies have already posted him.”</p>

<p>“Then what can we do, sir?” Jerry asked.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying, although I am at liberty to have
my own ideas. Anybody is permitted to think, but
it’s against regulations to think aloud sometimes.
I’m telling you these things as man to man. When
you grow up you may be an officer yourself, with
maps at your disposal. Well, if we can’t get at the
capital from the east, there ought to be other ways.
Napoleon laid down as a maxim of war: ‘Never do
what the enemy expects you to do.’ Santa Anna<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
expects General Scott to advance upon the city by the
eastern approaches, and I understand that he has
concentrated his batteries and men so as to defend
these approaches. Now you’ll see by the map that
beyond Mexicalcingo the cut-off road joins a main
road from the south, named the Acapulco road. And
that farther west there is still another main road
from the south.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” mused Jerry, pouring over the map
and following the lieutenant’s finger.</p>

<p>“There is a way to strike the Acapulco road, or
the other road, without reducing Mexicalcingo. An
army might—I do not say it could—but an army
of brave men might march around south of Lake
Chalco, here, and away south of Mexicalcingo, over
a very rough country, and reach the Acapulco road at
the town of San Augustine, about thirty miles from
where we now are. Thus we should avoid El Peñon
and Mexicalcingo, and approach the city from an unexpected
quarter, either the south or the west.”</p>

<p>“Maybe General Scott has thought of that, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant smiled again.</p>

<p>“No doubt he has. I rather surmise that he
thought of it at Puebla. I know he was busy gathering
information. But by all reports from our spies
and from the natives the route around south of Lake
Chalco is very bad, with lava rocks and sharp ridges
and bogs. It is so bad that the Mexicans themselves
rarely use it, and General Santa Anna has paid little
attention to it.”</p>

<p>“The same way he didn’t pay much attention to
that first hill at Cerro Gordo,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Cerro Gordo ought to have taught him, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
apparently it didn’t. He’s fairly good at tactics
and poor at strategy. General Scott shines in both.
I have an idea,” continued the lieutenant; and he
suddenly asked: “Can you keep a secret, boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Do so. I am telling you a secret—or
what may be a secret. It is quite likely that the
march upon the City of Mexico will be made by the
south. Captain Lee, of the engineers, has reconnoitred
the trail around the lake to San Augustine
and thinks it passable.”</p>

<p>“And we won’t have to fight, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll have fighting enough and to spare.
There are defenses over on the Acapulco road, and
Santa Anna will find out what we’re up to. It’s
simply a question whether he’ll dare move his forces
in time and leave the eastern approaches weakened.
You see Tlalpam, or San Augustine? North on the
road to the city there is the town of San Antonio,
which probably has strong batteries; and then Churubusco,
four miles from the city. After these are
taken, we should have to fight a way through the
interior line of defenses connected with the city
walls. But at San Augustine we shall be within nine
miles of the city and have the choice of several roads.
Yes,” smiled the lieutenant, folding the map, “we
shall be kept busy, officers, men and boys.”</p>

<p>The Third Division, under General Pillow, bringing
the new infantry regiments and the Voltigeurs,
arrived this afternoon. They all passed on through
Chalco and encamped two miles south at Chimalpa.
Now if the attacks were to be made from the east,
then the Second Division and the Quitman Volunteers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
and Marines would get in first, because they
already were on the main road. This put the First
and Third Divisions in the rear again, which was
not pleasing to them. But Jerry, hearing the talk,
smiled to himself, for he thought that he and Lieutenant
Grant knew different.</p>

<p>And thus it came about; for—</p>

<p>“Hooray, boys! The march is reversed. The
old First is to lead the way wance more.”</p>

<p>That was the word from Corporal Finerty, at
noon mess the next day in the village of Chalco, on
the eastern shore of Lake Chalco.</p>

<p>“An’ where do we go?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I ain’t been told yet, but you can figger
for yourselves. It won’t be by the main road, that’s
certain, where the Twiggs lads are ahead of us.”</p>

<p>The news set everybody on edge. The men
only waited for orders. In about two hours they
came from Brigade Adjutant Nichols, speaking for
Colonel Garland.</p>

<p>“Beat the assembly, drum major.”</p>

<p>At the initial taps the Fourth Regiment slung
haversacks and knapsacks and grasped muskets. The
other regiments were as alert. Drum Major Brown
signaled, and his drummers sounded To the Color.</p>

<p>There was brief inspection. Ranks were closed,
platoons formed, the First Division moved out into
the south instead of into the north. That was just
as Lieutenant Grant had predicted.</p>

<p>The Pillow division was under arms, two miles
on, but had not yet formed for a march. The First
trudged blithely by with good-natured jokes, and
left it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>When bivouac was made this evening in a cornfield
eight miles from Chalco the division was in
fine spirits. Old Fuss and Feathers and General
Worth were up to something, nobody knew exactly
what; but all, including Santa Anna, would soon
find out.</p>

<p>The next day’s march rounded the lake and
turned into the west among olive groves. Emerging
from these the leading ranks broke into a cheer.
In the north, far beyond the lake, there might be seen
El Peñon hill, a dark, bulky mass, with the Mexican
flag still flying defiantly from its top. Across the
head of another lake, in the northwest, Mexicalcingo
village was just visible with the Mexican flags marking
its batteries also. The division was side-stepping
these forts out of range.</p>

<p>“Faith, they don’t see us at all, at all. They’re
settin’ over their traps, an’ prisently we’ll be lookin’
at their backs!”</p>

<p>The road was getting bad. It wound along the
base of a bare mountain range that extended ridges
right into the new lake, Xochimilco. The horses
of Duncan’s battery had to be helped by hand; the
baggage train in the rear struggled with the steep
ravines cut into the sharp rock between ridges.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock in the morning another village,
San Gregorio, was reached. Here an aide came up
with dispatches for General Worth; the word spread
that an attack had been made upon one of the columns
behind. The division was to wait for instructions.</p>

<p>Then, at evening, all Colonel Harney’s cavalry
brigade, eight hundred dragoons, trotted in. They
said that a force of Mexican infantry and lancers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
had tried to cut off the Second Division, back at
Buena Vista on the way from Ayotla to march
around the lakes; but that Taylor’s battery of the
First Artillery had sent the red caps flying.</p>

<p>The Second Division and the Fourth Division
were following the Third and the First. The whole
army was on the move, flanking El Peñon and
Mexicalcingo, aiming to strike the Acapulco road
into Mexico City from the south.</p>

<p>The road to San Augustine grew worse. In
places there was scarcely space for the column to
pass between Lake Xochimilco and the mountain
slopes. The pioneers toiled. The Mexicans had
hastened to cut ditches and roll down logs; but the
artillery and the wagons were hauled through
and over.</p>

<p>Captain Mason of the engineers rode ahead, out
of sight, to reconnoitre. When he returned it was
reported that he had entered San Augustine itself,
and had found no soldiers.</p>

<p>“Column, attention! Close order—forward—march!”</p>

<p>With cavalry, infantry, four pieces of artillery
and seventy-five wagons the First Division marched
into San Antonio on the afternoon of August 17.</p>

<p>In camp this night many of the men thought that
now the way was open to the city. Remembering
the map and his talk with Lieutenant Grant, Jerry
feared different. So did others.</p>

<p>“Not yet, not yet, my lads,” said Sergeant Mulligan.
“We’ll have our fights. You can rist sure that
Santy Annie knows afore this what we’re about.
Ain’t the country full o’ spies for him? ’Tis a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
nine miles to thim Halls o’ Montezumy, an’ plenty
o’ room for batteries acrost the way. If I don’t miss
my guiss there’ll be troops an’ guns a-hurryin’
already, ’round by the city an’ down to head us off.
I hear tell that not two mile north is the first o’ the
trouble—a place called San Antonio, bristlin’ wid
guns; an’ Cherrybusco beyant, lookin’ the same. An’
bogs, an’ outworks, an’ the city walls beyant that.”</p>

<p>“Weel,” quoth Private MacPheel, “may the bullets
be distributed same as the pay, an’ mony a
braw fallow win through.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVI">XVI<br />
<small>FACING THE MEXICAN HOST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At eight in the morning assembly was ordered.
The division formed column. This looked like business.
General Scott had arrived; the Second, Third
and Fourth Divisions were coming rapidly. When
the First headed out of San Augustine, upon a broad
road leading to the north, Jerry himself felt a queer
little thrill. In that direction lay San Antonio, only
two miles and a half; beyond San Antonio was
Churubusco; and beyond Churubusco, Mexico City.</p>

<p>From San Augustine nothing could be seen of
the country north. The view was interrupted by a
great mass of blackish volcanic rock, thrown up like
lava, and cooled into all kinds of ugly shapes. It was
named El Pedrigal; was two miles north and south,
and three miles east and west.</p>

<p>The road turned northward around the east end
of the lava bed. In another mile the west end of
Lake Xochimilco opened, opposite on the right—and
the column suddenly halted. The road continued,
but half a mile before there stretched across it the
Mexican batteries of San Antonio.</p>

<p>Now the general officers consulted. In the column
heads wagged. With the marshes of the lake
upon the one hand and the jagged lava ridges upon
the other, and the road running between straight
into the breastworks, it did not look like a very
happy prospect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>“Order—arms! Battalion—rest!” barked
Major Francis Lee to the Fourth Infantry.</p>

<p>The whole column might stand at ease while
General Worth and his staff, riding to a better position,
examined the ground through their glasses.
An aide came with orders for the brigade.</p>

<p>“The general’s compliments, colonel, and you
will please encamp your brigade on the right of the
road,” he shouted, to Colonel Garland.</p>

<p>The regiments were moved over. The Second
Brigade also went into camp behind. The companies
were cautioned to stay near their stacked arms in
readiness for action. The flags of the Mexican batteries
could be seen plainly; the notes of their bugles
could be heard. A cannon boomed, and a round-shot
whined down the road.</p>

<p>“B’gorry, this day we make a horn or spoil a
spoon,” Corporal Finerty declared. “Who’s for
climbin’ over thim breastworks?”</p>

<p>“I!” and “I!” and “Here’s your man!” were
the replies.</p>

<p>“Less noise there, sergeant,” called Captain Gore.</p>

<p>“You hear? Hould your breaths, for you’ll nade
’em,” Sergeant Mulligan rebuked.</p>

<p>“Sure, sergeant, wan Cerry Gordo shout an’
thim beggars’d be showin’ us their heels,” Corporal
Finerty grinned.</p>

<p>“Here he comes! Old Fuss and Feathers himself!
’Tis like a smell o’ powder—the sight of him.
Are ye all primed, boys? We’re in for a fight.”</p>

<p>General Scott and staff galloped up. General
Worth received him at division headquarters in a
ranch house near the rear; they all proceeded to examine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
the country again from the roof of the house.
Pretty soon the engineers under Major J. L. Smith
and Captain James Mason (said to be almost the
equal of Captain Lee in cleverness) set out to reconnoitre
over the lava bed on the left; Captain Seth B.
Thornton’s company of the Second Dragoons detachment
filed along the edge of the lava to support them.</p>

<p>Both parties disappeared. The camp waited;
had dinner beside their stacked arms, the remaining
detachment of dragoons loafing likewise. Some of
the men slept in the warm sun. Jerry was dozing
off like an old campaigner, his shoulders bolstered
against his drum, when a “Boom! Boom” awakened
him with a start. The men around him were listening
and gazing, their faces a little paled. The officers
had stiffened, alert.</p>

<p>A cavalry horse galloped down the road, its saddle
empty, its stirrups flapping.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Thornton’s horse! It’s Cap’n Thornton’s
horse!”</p>

<p>As the horse swerved for the dragoons, all might
see that the saddle was bloody. When the Thornton
troopers rode in, they brought Captain Thornton’s
body, cut almost in two by a cannon ball. They had
reconnoitred too close to a masked battery.</p>

<p>The Mexican batteries were sending an occasional
shot in the direction of the division, bidding “Stand
off!” The engineers toiled back. They evidently
had found no route either by the left or the right of
the road, for toward evening the First Brigade was
moved a short distance aside and everybody knew
that the attack had been postponed. The Fourth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
Regiment secured quarters in a large stone barn—and
just in time. A cold rain began to fall.</p>

<p>The Mexican batteries kept firing at the barn with
a twenty-four-pounder; once in a while a round shot
landed upon the mud roof or shook the solid walls,
but the rain and the gathering dusk made poor practice
for them, and after a time the men grew used to
the bombardment.</p>

<p>Finally the shots ceased. Up the road the San
Antonio soldiers were having a celebration. There
was much singing and howling and squawking of
bands, together with the firing of muskets.</p>

<p>“Now I wonder what’s the reason of all that?”
Henry Brewer of Jerry’s mess remarked. “Is it
because they killed one man, or do they think they’ve
beaten us off? Seems to me it takes mighty little
to make those fellows happy.”</p>

<p>“Aye; and to-morrow they’ll be singing a different
tune,” said John Doane.</p>

<p>“Did soombody obsarve this marn that we’d be
makin’ a spoon or spoilin’ a horn?” asked Scotty
MacPheel. “Faith, whin we carry yon batteries
I doot soom of us’ll no hae muckle mair use for a
spoon or any ither tool except a spade.”</p>

<p>“Right-o, Scotty,” Corporal Finerty agreed.
“For me military eye tells me there’s a job ahead
of us, though I’m not sayin’ the First Division can’t
handle it. Sure it’s no secret what the ingineers
reported; all the officers know it, an’ I’ve an ear on
either side o’ my topknot. The Mexicans ferninst
us are snug an’ tight, wid a reinforcement o’ two
regiments from the north, an’ thray thousand men all
tould, an’ batteries fetched clear from El Peñon an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
that other place, Mexicalcingo. Their right rists on
the lavy that only infantry can travel; their lift
ixtends clean into the bogs, where no man nor horse
can make way around. An’ in front we got to
charge in along this same open road, an’ belike have
to put up scalin’ ladders to get in wid for use o’
the bayonet.”</p>

<p>“You talk like an officer, Finerty.”</p>

<p>“Yis, an’ I’m givin’ yez officers’ talk. If I had
me desarts a gin’ral I’d ha’ been before this. An’
somethin’ else I’ll tell you. Yonder at the other side
those lavy ridges, an’ only thray miles, is another set
o’ batteries, an’ we can’t pass betwixt. There’s another
road, too, west’ard, an’ a cross road connectin’
this and that, by way o’ Cherrybusco beyant San
Antonio. So if we do take San Antonio, an’ Cherrybusco,
won’t we have thim fellows on our backs?
Now I’m figgerin’ that the gin’ral staff is thinkin’
a bit on how to carry the batteries yonder, first.”</p>

<p>The night passed peacefully. Duncan’s battery
had been posted to command the road, the sentinels
regularly sang: “All’s well,” and the camp slept. In
the huge stone barn the Fourth Regiment was as comfortable
as could be.</p>

<p>August 19, the next day, dawned bright and
warm. Word came that all the divisions were now
up as far as San Augustine. By the number of
aides and orderlies dashing back and forth between
the First Division headquarters and San Augustine,
something was due to happen.</p>

<p>The orders of the day kept everybody close.
Jerry had no opportunity to look up Hannibal, and
Hannibal was unable to look him up, either. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
air seemed filled with suspense. The Mexican batteries
up the road stayed very alert, expecting an attack.
But the brigade officers, within sight of Jerry, constantly
trained their glasses upon the lava field to the
west—really paying more attention to that than to
San Antonio.</p>

<p>Then about the middle of the afternoon the dull
booming of artillery and the crash of musketry
came rolling across the bristling lava. Speedily two
clouds of smoke rose toward the sun; both were three
or four miles away. The larger one veiled a hill
that just showed itself above the lava field.</p>

<p>It was a battle at last. The large cloud was from
the Mexican batteries, the smaller cloud from the
American guns.</p>

<p>General Worth and a group of officers had issued
upon the flat roof of the ranch house headquarters
to gaze at the smoke. Division Adjutant Captain
William Mackall galloped in from the headquarters
to Colonel Garland; Brigade Adjutant Nichols bore
the orders to Major Lee of the Fourth Regiment.</p>

<p>“The battalions are to stand in line, at rest,
major, prepared to move.”</p>

<p>“Battalion, attention!”</p>

<p>Officers ran to their places; the men, who had
been sitting down, sprang up.</p>

<p>“Right—dress! Front! Order—arms! Battalion—rest!”</p>

<p>So the regiments waited for the command to
march.</p>

<p>“We’ll be going yonder and lend a hand.” This
was the hope. But although the firing grew heavier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
and the smoke clouds denser, no further orders
arrived from headquarters.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was plain to be seen that things
were not altogether right in the west. General Worth
and staff still stood outlined upon the flat roof of the
ranch house, peering steadily through their glasses;
the brigade and regimental officers were anxiously
gazing, too; and presently the company officers
drifted into little knots and gazed and murmured.</p>

<p>The smaller black cloud was stationary; it had
not advanced, the Mexican cloud had lessened not
at all. By the sounds the American batteries were
lighter in metal. The smoke clouds remained
separate—the American forces seemed to be getting
nowhere.</p>

<p>The faces of the officers lengthened; the men in
the ranks began to mutter restlessly.</p>

<p>“Send in the First. Sure, we’re the boys. Leave
those fellows in front of us, and we’ll tend to
’em later.”</p>

<p>The First Division stood ready until sunset.
When the firing died away, the positions of the two
smoke clouds had little changed. The Mexicans
upon the hill certainly had held out.</p>

<p>“You may break ranks, major,” the adjutant
called to Major Lee. “The men are to be dismissed
for supper.”</p>

<p>This left matters very unsatisfactory. Before
supper Jerry sallied out from the barn. The officers
still were in little groups, talking earnestly. Whenever
any of the enlisted men came near to them, they
immediately quit talking, as if they had been discussing
bad news. Jerry waited until he had a chance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
to catch Lieutenant Grant alone. Then he went up
to him.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, lieutenant, but could you tell me
anything about the battle? The men are afraid it
hadn’t gone right.”</p>

<p>“We don’t know much more than the rest of
you,” the lieutenant answered. “General Worth
probably is expecting news. But if you’ll promise
not to spread discouraging word among the men,
I’ll explain the best I can.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well. As far as I understand, General
Scott is operating on a triangle. The base of the
triangle is formed by this road, from San Augustine
to Churubusco, with San Antonio at about the middle
of it. The lava field occupies the inside of the
triangle. The point of the triangle, west across the
lava, is a hill called Contreras, which the Mexicans
have fortified strongly. We cannot pass San Antonio
by the road, without much difficulty, in order to get
at Churubusco beyond and open the way to the capital.
But while we mask San Antonio and keep it
on the alert, General Scott purposes to throw the
other divisions from San Augustine out along the
south side of the triangle, carry the Mexican fortifications
at the point, and then by marching eastward
again along the north side of the triangle strike
Churubusco and San Antonio at their rear, or in
reverse. We, of course, will be called upon for a
frontal attack at the same time. Now by the appearance
of things I fear, myself, that the general has
run against a stronger position than he anticipated,
and that matters have not gone according to plan.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
He had the engineers under Captain Lee reconnoitring
the enemy yesterday. They found a mule trail
leading from San Augustine through the lava to the
batteries at Contreras. Evidently the ground has
proved difficult for artillery, as I noted the reports of
only three light guns on our side.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ve been whipped, lieutenant?”
Jerry asked, his heart sinking.</p>

<p>“N-no, not exactly whipped, in the true sense of
the word,” Lieutenant Grant soberly said. “There’s
been no call upon us for reinforcements, and it did
not sound like a very heavy battle. But the way this
army is fixed, cut loose from communications and
over two hundred miles in the enemy’s country, if we
don’t take a place when we really attack it we might
as well be whipped. We can’t afford to lose men
for nothing.”</p>

<p>“We’ll win yet, then; won’t we, sir?”</p>

<p>“General Scott is there. You may be sure that
he’ll find a way. A small force can hold San Antonio
in check. It is acting strictly on the defensive.”</p>

<p>“If troops are sent for, I hope they’ll be the First
Brigade,” Jerry blurted.</p>

<p>“Yes,” smiled Lieutenant Grant; “so do I.”</p>

<p>The regulation night’s rain was commencing to
fall. Jerry hastened back for the stone barn and
supper. That was rather a gloomy mess. They all
somehow knew that the attack over at Contreras had
failed; all wondered what Old Fuss and Feathers
would do next; what regiments had been cut up, why
the First Division had not been given a chance, and
so forth, and so forth.</p>

<p>“Ah, weel, to-morrow’ll be a bludy day, I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
thinkin’, lads,” spoke Scotty. “The gen’ral’s no
mon to gie oop. I vote for a gude sleep, mysel’, an’
I sartainly peety them who hae their bivouac in the
starm. Gude sakes, leesten to the pour doon!”</p>

<p>The rain had merged into a terrific storm of
thunder and lightning and gusty wind that lashed
the barn with giants’ flails. Luckily the Fourth
Regiment was snug within the dripping eaves; but
what of the troops camped in the open, covered
by only their blankets? They would be drenched!
And what of the men on the battlefield? The
wounded, and the weary!</p>

<p>While thinking and listening to the rain, and
drowsily watching the smouldering campfires in the
great barn, Jerry dozed off. He awakened to the
sound of low voices. A group of non-commissioned
officers was squatting near him, beside a fire, and
talking guardedly among themselves—or seemed to
be interested in a story. All through the barn the
ranks were stretched under blankets upon the floor,
snoring and gurgling. Jerry promptly rolled out
and crept to the group. Sergeant Mulligan and Corporal
Finerty were there from his company.</p>

<p>They stopped murmuring.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?”</p>

<p>“Jerry Cameron, is all.”</p>

<p>“Get back to bed. We want no young rascal
of a drummer sittin’ in with us.”</p>

<p>“’Asy, now. He’s not as bad as the rist of
’em,” Sergeant Mulligan said. “He’s all right;
knows how to kape a still tongue in his head. Sure,
I see him talkin’ wid Left’nant Grant, betimes, an’
niver a word did I get out of him. Let him stay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>“Mind you, then, nothin’ of this to the men,”
Corporal Finerty warned. “Go on, Murray.”</p>

<p>The center of the group was Corporal Murray, of
Company A, who had been orderly at headquarters.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying,” proceeded Corporal
Murray, “the story of the battle is like this—just as
I got it with my two ears when the orderly from Old
Fuss and Feathers rode in with dispatches to division
headquarters and I listened through the door. General
Valencia, who ranks next to Santy Annie himself,
is over on Contreras hill, with twenty-two
pieces of artillery, mainly heavy guns, and with six
thousand infantry and lancers, blocking the way
around by the west the same as those fellows at San
Antonio are blocking our way north’ard. So this
morning the general-in-chief sent Pillow’s division of
new regulars, with Cap’n Magruder’s light battery of
the First Artillery from the Second Division and
Left’nant Callender’s howitzers, to open the trail
discovered by the engineers; and the Second Division
under Twiggs was ordered to support.</p>

<p>“Well, and a time they all had, sure enough.
The engineers hadn’t been able by reason of the
nature of the ground to get clost enough to count
the batteries, or quite figger their positions, but they’d
took a scattering of prisoners before being driven
back, and Old Fuss and Feathers examined these.
Now the trail was fierce, in the open, like, all heaved
up into sharp rocks and broken by holes, and never
a bit of shelter once our men had climbed atop the
lava field. And at two thousand yards the Mexican
eighteens had a fair sweep, whilst Magruder and
Callender couldn’t reply at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>“But the men and horses dragged at the guns and
took their medicine. The Mounted Rifles afoot were
sent forward to clean out the Mexican skirmishers,
and that they did. ’Twas not the sharp rocks and
the holes alone, but the cactus was something scandalous,
and down in front of the hill there were ditches
and corn patches, fine for skirmish work. Never
mind, the Rifles kept at it. Sure, boys, if Magruder
and Callender didn’t get their guns to within nine
hundred yards, and there they planted ’em, and
opened up.</p>

<p>“Persifor Smith’s First Brigade of the Second
Division formed our left o’ line; that new general,
Pierce, marched into right of line with his Second
Brigade of Pillow’s Third Division, being the Ninth,
Twelfth and Fifteenth Infantry; the other new general,
Cadwalader, moved in to support with his
First Brigade, the Voltigeurs and the ’Leventh and
Fourteenth regiments; old Bennet Riley with the
Second and Seventh Regulars and the Fourth
Artillery of the Twiggs’ Second Brigade was sent
around by our right flank to take the Mexicans in
reverse and occupy a village north’ard on their
left rear.</p>

<p>“There was a ravine in front of the line, and all
cleared of brush, with the Mexicans up the opposite
slope entrenched, their lancers and infantry covering
their flanks and a road leading north for the City of
Mexico. ’Tis the road which connects by a crossroad
with this road of ourn, at Cherrybusco. Our
infantry stood no show of storming the hill from in
front—not across that ravine; and for two hours the
batteries had a fearful time with twenty guns pounding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
’em. Left’nant Callender, of the howitzers, was
bad wounded, Lef’nant J. P. Johnston, of Magruder’s,
got his death, and we could work only three
guns together, owing to the nature of the ground.
The Rifles lay flat, supporting the batteries; and so
did the gunners, and jumped up when they served the
pieces. ’Twasn’t long before the whole two batteries
were put out of action; hadn’t made any impression
upon the breastworks with their twelve-pounders,
and had to be withdrawn.”</p>

<p>“Where was Scott all that time?”</p>

<p>“Right there, up toward the front. Riley was
getting through, ’midst the lava, ’round the enemy’s
left, so as to take the village north’ards on the road,
and put a wedge betwixt Valencia and Santy Annie.
For I tell you Santy Annie himself was up the road
about two miles with twelve thousand more Mexicans,
ready to reinforce if necessary. He’d been
feeding in troops right along. Now to nip that in
the bud and to help Riley, Scott ordered Cadwalader
forward by like route, sent for Shield’s brigade of
Mohawks—the New Yorkers and South Caroliny
Palmettos in waiting at San Augustine—and added
Pierce’s Fifteenth Infantry. Pierce’s horse fell in
the rocks and hurt the general’s knee, but Colonel
Morgan took the Fifteenth to position. Old Davy
(Twiggs, you know) on his own hook had detached
Persifor Smith with the Rifles, First Artillery and
Third Infantry, to the same point. And at dark
there they all were, every regiment, under Smith:
posted near the village at Valencia’s left and rear—thirty-three
hundred of ’em, cut off from Twiggs
on the south by the six thousand of Valencia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
and threatened on the north by Santy Annie’s
twelve thousand.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done nixt, wud ye think?”</p>

<p>“Cap’n Lee, of the engineers, made his way back
to general headquarters at San Augustine. He got
in about eleven o’clock with dispatches—the only
officer out of eight that tried to open communication
between Smith and Scott. He came all the way from
Smith, some four miles across the lava, and through
the Mexican scouts—had to feel with hands and
knees, for it’s black as the inside of your hat, out
doors, and raining pitchforks. Smith intends to
attack by the rear at daylight, before Santy Annie
gets down from up the road; asks for a frontal
attack at same time to help him out. So I guess
we’ll all be in it, for Twiggs’ll need every man.”</p>

<p>A little silence fell on the group. Jerry’s heart
beat rapidly. The situation seemed serious.</p>

<p>“I pity those poor fellows yonder acrost the
lava,” Sergeant Mulligan uttered. “Hark to the
rain, now! It’s a crool night. An’ they’ve been
marchin’ an’ fightin’ all the long day, an’ likely the
most of ’em are lyin’ out soakin’ wet an’ hungry
besides. Did we lose many, have you heard?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t heard exactly, sergeant. The batteries
lost fifteen officers and men and thirteen horses. The
infantry got off better, for the batteries took the
brunt of it. But to-morrow——. You see, at San
Augustine there are only the Marines and Second
Pennsylvania; and here we are. That’s the reserve,
except the dragoons—and they’re no good on the
lava. Twiggs has only the Ninth and Twelfth
Regulars of Pierce’s brigade in Pillow’s Third Division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
in front of Valencia. To make a proper diversion
there and support Smith and mebbe hold off
Santy Annie he’ll need help. I’ll go you a month’s
pay we’ll be called on before daylight.”</p>

<p>“Faith, if we’re in for a fight, I mane to sleep,”
Sergeant Mulligan growled.</p>

<p>The group broke up. Jerry crept back to bed.
He scarcely had dropped off into an uneasy sleep
himself when the galloping hoofs of a horse aroused
him—just as if he had been expecting the very thing.</p>

<p>The horse passed the barn in a hurry; bound
for Colonel Garland’s headquarters, perhaps. Orders!
In five minutes the sentry on post outside the
barn challenged again:</p>

<p>“Who comes there?”</p>

<p>A voice answered shortly. Then the door
opened, and the same voice—that of Adjutant
Nichols—shouted:</p>

<p>“Men! Men! Wake up, all hands! First sergeants,
parade your companies and call the rolls immediately.
The officers will then take command.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVII">XVII<br />
<small>CLEARING THE ROAD TO THE CAPITAL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was something in the ring of the adjutant’s
voice which wakened every man in a jiffy,
as though they all had been dreaming of battle.</p>

<p>“Beat the long roll, drummers!”</p>

<p>But already the vast room was astir with voices
and figures. Fires were being kicked together, lanterns
and candles being lighted; the companies
formed in half darkness; they called off. Outside,
the rain was still pouring.</p>

<p>“Where we going now?”</p>

<p>“What time is it, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Two o’clock, my lad.”</p>

<p>“B’jabers, we’ll nade cat’s eyes.”</p>

<p>“Weel, there’ll be licht enow whin the powder
burns.”</p>

<p>“Be it to San Antonio or to Contreras, I
wonder.”</p>

<p>“What difference to you, whether up the road
or down?”</p>

<p>“’Tis to Contreras, wid this early start. I’m
thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“An’ do we go on empty stomicks?”</p>

<p>“We’re to help out the other lads at Contreras,
boys,” said a sergeant. “Five or six miles is all.
So what does the matter of an empty stomach count?
You can eat from your haversacks as we march;
and by breakfast time we’ll be sampling the camp
fare of those Mexicans. We’ll be fair in time for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
breakfast with ’em, and the fires’ll all be made to
save us the trouble.”</p>

<p>The company officers had bustled in; got the
reports from the first sergeants. There were orders.</p>

<p>“Company A, by the left flank! Left—face!
For’d—march!”</p>

<p>“Company B, by the left flank! Left—face!
For’d—march! Right oblique—march!”</p>

<p>And so on. Thus they all filed out of the barn
door into the rain and the darkness, where the regimental
officers were waiting.</p>

<p>“By company, into line—march! Left wheel—march!
Company—halt! Right—dress!”</p>

<p>“Sure, how can a man right dress when he
can’t see?”</p>

<p>“Silence in the ranks!”</p>

<p>“Form platoons—quick—march!”</p>

<p>“Close up on the leading company, captains!”</p>

<p>It was a jumble. Jerry found his place with the
rest of the music by guesswork.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Jerry?” little Mike Malloy, drummer
of Company A, whispered. His teeth were
chattering.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mike.”</p>

<p>“An’ are we goin’ into battle?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it, Mike.”</p>

<p>“Oh, murther,” Mike groaned. “We’ll all be dead
wid cold before we get kilt entoirely wid bullets.”</p>

<p>“Battalion, forward—route step—march! Close
up, men; close up,” shouted Major Lee. “Don’t
straggle. Drum major, sound a march.”</p>

<p>“How can we sound a march wid the drums
soaked an’ the fifes drownded?” Mike complained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>The First Brigade was in motion, marching back
down the road for San Augustine. The music proved
a dismal failure. Presently, stumbling and slipping
in the mud, with clothes and knapsacks weighing a
ton to the man, the column was passing the camp of
the Second Brigade. The Second Brigade’s fires
had long been quenched, but sentries could be dimly
seen; beside the road figures were lying rolled in
blankets, lights were glimmering feebly in the guard
tent and brigade headquarter’s tent.</p>

<p>The Second Brigade was not going! The First
Brigade had been selected! Hooray! And the
Clarke men would be sick when they knew. Jerry
chuckled to himself, thinking of Hannibal, who was
missing out. At the same time he wondered whether
he would see Hannibal again. But General Worth
was with the First. His voice had been heard. And
no doubt Old Fuss and Feathers was impatiently
waiting, bent upon victory.</p>

<p>Slosh, slosh, slide and stumble, in the downpour
and the blackness.</p>

<p>“Close up, men! Close up! Keep in touch.”</p>

<p>After what seemed to be a long, long time they
were trudging heavily through silent San Augustine,
south of the lava field. Except for cavalry pickets, it
appeared to be deserted. The reserve there—the
Marines and Second Pennsylvania—had gone. General
Scott of course had gone. All the infantry and
artillery were being gathered at Contreras for a
decisive fight.</p>

<p>Slosh, slosh, slide and stumble and grumble.
After another long time the darkness began to thin.
Pretty soon the column might see the muddy road<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
and the outskirts. The clouds were breaking over the
mountains in the south and the lava field in the north.
The road was thickly marked by footprints and by
furrows filled with water, where the artillery wheels
had cut deeply.</p>

<p>The way veered sharply north into the lava field,
amidst curious ashy cones high with flat tops as if
they had burst open; the brush had been hacked down
and leveled and crushed. General Worth and staff
spurred ahead. The sun was reddening the east.
Jerry could see the men’s faces, pinched and dirty,
white and unshaven. The ranks were panting—their
shoes clogged with mud, their uniforms drenched
and smeared, their guns and knapsacks dripping.
How far were Contreras and the Mexican army now?
A fight would be warming, if nothing else. Any
instant a halt might be ordered to recharge the
muskets and get ready.</p>

<p>Hark! The fresh morning air was set atremble
by another roll of cannon and musketry fire. Smoke
arose before, maybe two miles distant in the northwest.
The battle had opened again; the men strained
forward. Adjutant Nichols galloped back along
the ranks.</p>

<p>“Hurry, men! At the double! Sound the
double, there, drum major! Come, come, men!
Double time—march!”</p>

<p>Colonel Garland had turned and shouted and
waved his sword. Jerry essayed to join in beating
double time. The men tried to respond. They
surged into a shambling trot, but they could not keep
it up on the slippery road, carrying their soaked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
clothes and knapsacks, their muskets and mud-laden
shoes.</p>

<p>They grunted and panted and wheezed and stumbled.
The firing had increased under the smoke
cloud. It continued furiously for about a quarter
of an hour, while the First Brigade toiled at its best
and the officers urged. Then the battle tumult died
almost as quickly as it had been born; and there
were cheers, instead, not the shrill “Vivas” of the
Mexicans, but the hearty “Huzzahs” from American
throats.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, boys! The works are taken. Hear
that? It’s victory!”</p>

<p>“Huzzah, huzzah, huzzah!”</p>

<p>The column actually quickened pace over the wet
brush and lava rocks, with faces flushed by excitement.
The sun beams touched the tips of the lava
cones—and see! Away off there, where the smoke
cloud swirled in the morning breeze, the Stars and
Stripes gleamed from the top of a hill. The firing
still persisted, lessened by distance, as if the Mexicans
were being pursued northward.</p>

<p>Here came General Worth, splashing recklessly
down the rough trail, his horse lathered with sweat,
his dark, handsome face shining as he waved his hat.</p>

<p>“Contreras is taken. Halt your column,
colonel.” Then his face stiffened. “What’s this,
sir? The orders were to leave the knapsacks on a
forced march. Now instead of being fresh for a
hard day’s fight my men are broken down already!
This is no way to bring soldiers upon the field.
Counter-march, sir, as soon as possible, to our old
position, and await further orders to advance on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
enemy. Deposit the knapsacks there and let the men
rest, sir.”</p>

<p>He spoke loudly and angrily. Colonel Garland
answered not a word, but whitened and saluted. The
general had been heard by half the brigade. They
gave him a cheer. He was a leader to be depended
upon when it was a matter of fighting. Rather nervous,
beforehand, but a reliable commander in
the field.</p>

<p>Now for San Antonio, no doubt. Back they were
marched, through the mud, five miles—and every
foot of the way they feared that the Second Brigade
might be in ahead of them, after all. But it was not.
It was only under arms. They exchanged cheers
with it, as grimy and tired and hungry they plodded
by. Jerry saw Hannibal standing, drum slung, in
the field-music ranks of the Eighth, and reported to
him with a flourish of the arm.</p>

<p>At the old camping place, near the big barn, the
First Brigade took time to swallow hot coffee, scrape
some of the mud off, and dry in the warm sunshine.
But all too soon orders were given to fall in, with
blanket rolls, and with two days’ rations of beef and
bread in the haversacks. The lieutenants and first
sergeants passed along behind the ranks, inspecting
every cartridge box, weeding out the cartridges that
looked wet, and inserting fresh ones. The loads
were withdrawn from the muskets; dry loads were
rammed home. Serious business was ahead.</p>

<p>The ranks were closed. The regimental commanders
made short speeches to their men. Major
Francis Lee addressed the Fourth.</p>

<p>“Men,” he said, “we are going into battle. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
First Division has the honor of forcing San Antonio
from the front, to open the road for the heavy artillery,
while the Pillow new regiments are taking it
in reverse or at the rear. But they have the longer
way to come, from Contreras, and the First Division
must get in first. Then we shall push right on to
Churubusco and join the fight there.”</p>

<p>“Huzzah! Huzzah!”</p>

<p>“We have good news to support us, and do not
need any help from the Pillow men.”</p>

<p>“No, no!”</p>

<p>“Contreras entrenchments were taken in seventeen
minutes by only two thousand men. The Riley
Brigade of the Second Division, composed of the
Second and Seventh Infantry, the Fourth Artillery,
with the Rifles added, took it alone at the point of
the bayonet. General Cadwalader’s Eleventh Infantry
and Voltigeurs followed close. The remainder
of the Second Division, being the Third Infantry and
First Artillery, led by Major Dimick in place of
General Persifor Smith, who commanded the whole
movement, arrived in time to break the last resistance,
and the rout was received by General Shield’s New
Yorkers and Palmettos on the road north. But the
colors of the Seventh Infantry were again the first to
be raised. The Fourth Artillery captured two of its
guns that had been lost at Buena Vista last spring.
The entire Mexican force of seven thousand troops,
called the ‘flower of the Mexican army,’ was dispersed,
leaving two thousand dead, wounded and
prisoners, all the artillery, ammunition, provisions,
and the military chest. Our own loss is less than
sixty. The only fortified points between us and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
the capital, seven short miles, are San Antonio and
Churubusco; and these are being enveloped by the
victors of Contreras. Let us push on, so that our
comrades of the other divisions shall not do all the
fighting. Now, three cheers for victory!”</p>

<p>They cheered thunderously. The drums rolled.
The two other regiments—Second and Third Artillery—were
cheering. But see! The Second Brigade
had passed—was obliquing out over the lava field,
on the west or left, as if to make circuit and attack
the enemy’s flank. The ranks and their flags dipped
amidst the sharp ridges.</p>

<p>“Companies, right wheel—march! Forward,
quick—march!”</p>

<p>Huzzah! The First Brigade also was off. The
time was about eight o’clock in this morning of
August 20.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the breastworks of San Antonio
village were plainly visible not half a mile
up the road. They extended to the lava on the west;
on the east they stretched through marshy ground in
shape of a long quarter circle bending back so as
to front the bogs of the lake.</p>

<p>The lava side was bad enough, but the other side
was worse. The First Brigade kept on by the road.</p>

<p>“Fourth Battalion, by the left flank—march!
Hurry up, men!”</p>

<p>Assistant Adjutant-General Mackall, of the division
staff, had shouted. The ranks of the Fourth immediately
left-faced. In double file they scrambled
down from the high road and formed company front
again in the muddy cornfield that lay between the
road and the lava field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>“Battalion, forward—quick time—march!”</p>

<p>The drums tapped quick time. Now the Second
Brigade was well out in the lava, its line of battle
resembling a great flock of goats. The Fourth Infantry
was next, at the same side of the road but
below, hurrying through the boggy cornfield. The
remainder of the First Brigade stretched across the
road and was forging straight on.</p>

<p>“Bang! Bang! Bangity-bang-bang-bang-g-g-g!”</p>

<p>The Second Brigade was in action—perhaps driving
the Mexican skirmishers. Hannibal was there
with the Eighth. The firing increased to battle din;
cheers echoed, smoke drifted, and in the corn the
Fourth Infantry could see little except the green
stalks and the mud and the ditches that had been cut.</p>

<p>“Trail arms! Double time—march!”</p>

<p>How they hustled, almost dead with the ten and
more miles marched already, and with stomachs
curiously empty again. Beating the double, Jerry
and the other drummers had hard work to hold
their places. They and the fifers formed two ranks
behind the left center company; this was the field
music position in order of battle.</p>

<p>“Battalion, ready! Stoop, men!”</p>

<p>The musket locks clicked. Close before, between
the stalks of corn, breastworks could be seen, the
muzzles of cannon staring blackly. The Mexicans
were reserving their fire here; but out to the left
the firing had grown fiercer and was traveling on
toward San Antonio. Farther in the north other
firing swelled louder and louder. But here——!
Why didn’t the Mexican breastworks open? Anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
was better than this suspense, when a sheet
of flame was expected every moment!</p>

<p>“Forward, men! Forward! Steady!” And
suddenly: “Fourth Infantry—charge!”</p>

<p>“Hooray! Huzzah! Huzzah!”</p>

<p>The drums beat the charge, Jerry pounding lustily
as he ran. The men yelled—a Cerro Gordo shout.
They stumbled, fell, splashed into ditches four feet
wide. Lieutenant Grant was running and waving his
sword in front of his company. All the officers were
cheering on their men. The breastworks loomed
higher, the cannon muzzles gaped wider.</p>

<p>The line swept on; the front rank began to climb—the
men slipping and clutching and clinging, and
ever advancing their muskets to pull trigger. Over
they went with yells renewed; up and over went the
rear rank, and over went the fifers and drummers,
tumbling into the cheering mass.</p>

<p>The breastworks were empty. Onward extended
the road, with the Mexican artillery and infantry,
mingling with horses and women, legging pellmell
in a mass for San Antonio town—through the little
town and out again.</p>

<p>“On, men! On!”</p>

<p>Now it was a race. Look! The Second Brigade
was closing in and firing. So rapidly it descended
from the lava, beyond the village, that it struck the
rout right in the middle—cut the mass in two. The
first portion broke and fled east, across the fields;
the Second Brigade halted in the gap, while the other
half of the Mexicans scurried faster up the road
for Churubusco.</p>

<p>The Fourth Infantry joined the Second Brigade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
at the instant when the remainder of the First Brigade
came in. Everybody was laughing and cheering,
but there was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>“To the color! Beat to the color, drummers!
Battalions, form companies! Forward—double time—march!”</p>

<p>The First Division ran on. The whole elevated
road before was a sight. The two miles to Churubusco,
lined by shade trees, was a solid jumble of
Mexicans—infantry, artillery, lancers, camp followers
and baggage wagons, flying for dear life.
Wounded were dropping out, guns were being abandoned,
teamsters and cannoneers were lashing their
horses. It was a rout indeed.</p>

<p>And yonder in the northwest another rout pelted
in: Santa Anna’s reserves, from near Contreras,
pursued hotly by the Twiggs Second Division, all
aiming for Churubusco.</p>

<p>The First Division was right upon the heels of the
San Antonio fugitives. The men were wild with
excitement; nobody thought now of weariness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII<br />
<small>IN THE CHARGE AT CHURUBUSCO</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Churubusco, into which the Mexicans from the
south and from the west were pouring, bristled with
defenses. They seemed to be mainly on the left
or west of the road. First, there was the straggling
village, half encircled by breastworks, with an immense
stone church rising high above everything,
and already spouting smoke from its cannon mounted
upon the walls and the flat roof. There were cornfields
and fruit trees upon both sides of the road, and
beyond the church there was a stone bridge carrying
the road across what appeared to be a large canal,
reaching from the lake on the east into the cornfields
and meadows of the west. It was at least
a mile in length, piled with earth on either bank,
like a dike, and absolutely filled with infantry and
artillery, protected by the earthen parapets.</p>

<p>The end of the bridge in front of the earthworks,
at the middle of the dike, had been built up into a
regular stone fort, containing a battery under cover.
While farther on, occupying the road after it had left
the village and the bridge, there were thousands
more infantry and lancers, swelled by the Santa
Anna force.</p>

<p>The column had halted, the men ceased cheering,
and General Worth and staff surveyed Churubusco
through their glasses.</p>

<p>It was an anxious moment. The enemy certainly
numbered twenty thousand, well stationed. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
bridgehead and the dike had opened with cannon balls
which came ricocheting down the road and splashed
the mud and water of the cornfields. But the men
paid little attention to them. Hooray! Here was
General Pillow, at last, with the General Cadwalader
brigade of Voltigeurs and Eleventh and Fourteenth
Infantry—toiling in from the west and uniting
with the First Division on the road. He had
arrived too late for San Antonio, but was in time
for Churubusco.</p>

<p>The men were growing impatient. Within a few
minutes the gunfire from Churubusco had risen deafening.
The church was being attacked; it fairly
vomited smoke and shot and shell; every inch of it
seemed alive. The fields to the west of it were answering.
Infantry in thin lines could be seen stealing
forward; a battery was hammering hard.</p>

<p>“Twiggs! Old Davy’s there, with Taylor’s
battery!”</p>

<p>How the men knew, nobody could tell; but know
they did. The word passed that General Persifor
Smith’s First Artillery and Third Infantry were
attacking the church. They appeared to be suffering,
for they were within point-blank range of the roof-top
and the cupola, and had no cover except the corn.</p>

<p>Another brigade—Colonel Riley’s Second and
Seventh Infantry—was hastening to the support of
General Smith. The firing had spread to the north,
as if an attack was being made all along the line of
the road. The time was nearing noon but the smoke
welled in such a cloud that it hid the sun. Amidst the
terrific uproar of artillery and small-arms the orders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
of the First Division officers could scarcely be heard,
here half a mile away from the battle.</p>

<p>“Column, attention! Forward—march!”</p>

<p>The cannon balls tore in more and more viciously.
The musketry of the bridgehead also opened. Men
were falling.</p>

<p>“Column, right half wheel—march!”</p>

<p>In column of companies they left the road and
descended into the muddy cornfields again on the
right. One company stayed upon the road. It was
the gallant Sixth Infantry, advancing alone, moving
very steadily, the men gripping their muskets at right
shoulder shift. The bluff old Major Bonneville, that
bald-headed veteran who, on leave of absence in
1832, had been a fur hunter across the Rocky Mountains,
commanded the Sixth. He was a Frenchman,
but had graduated from the Military Academy in
1813, so he was no new hand at the fighting game.</p>

<p>The Cadwalader Voltigeurs had been stationed in
reserve. The two other regiments—the Eleventh and
Fourteenth—had joined the Second Brigade. The
First Brigade, Colonel Garland leading a-horse,
swung out wider to the right, and on through the
corn, at the double, came the Second Brigade, to
march between the First Brigade and the road.</p>

<p>Unless the Garland brigade hurried, the Clarke
column would strike the bridgehead first, on the
shorter inside track.</p>

<p>The Sixth Regiment was drawing the bridgehead
fire. The companies were rushing forward,
muskets at a ready, but they met such a storm of iron
and lead that they crumpled, stopped, and firing
furiously, took shelter along the sides of the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>“On the first battalion, deploy column! Battalions,
right face—quick—march!”</p>

<p>It was a wonder that the order, issuing from the
red face of Adjutant Nichols, could be heard at all.
The First Brigade extended to the right at a run,
and front-faced on line of battle. Jerry and the field
music of the Fourth were behind again; now the
positions of the lieutenants was two paces in the rear
of the rear rank of their companies. It chanced
that Lieutenant Grant was directly before Jerry’s
place in the rank of drummers. Jerry kept an eye
upon him.</p>

<p>These cornfields were cut by ditches of water as
the others had been. The double line grew ragged
as the men leaped the ditches. The bridgehead and
the dike were firing—with patter and hiss the grape-shot
and bullets ripped through the corn. The Mexican
works were higher than the cornfield, so that
the division’s advance could be seen while the Mexicans
themselves were concealed.</p>

<p>Oh, but it was frightful in that cornfield! “Center
guide, men! Keep up with the colors. Center
guide!” Lieutenant Grant and the other officers
shouted constantly. The color guard of the regiment
pressed stanchly, braced and holding the Stars and
Stripes and the flag of the Fourth Infantry above
the murderous hail. Men were falling fast; they
plunged, or reeled and sank, some of them in the
mud and some of them into the water. As quickly
as gaps occurred in the front rank, men from the
second rank sprang forward and filled the spaces.
The corn bowed to the withering blast. Ahead,
Mexicans were jumping up and dodging for cover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
after firing. The enemy’s skirmishers were being
dislodged from their holes.</p>

<p>What a noise! Thousands of guns, large and
small, near and far, speaking at once! The whole
American army, except a tiny reserve, was engaged
with the whole Mexican army in the field. It was
a fight to a finish of eight thousand against twenty
thousand. Somewhere General Scott directed. It
was safe to say that Old Fuss and Feathers knew just
what was going to happen; his plans had been made;
and although the First Division, with the help of
General Cadwalader’s two regiments, seemed to
have been given the toughest job in the taking of
the bridgehead and the opening of the road, Jerry
for one had not the slightest doubt of the result.
The Mexicans would be threshed, of course.</p>

<p>On surged the double line and on; bending and
weaving and staggering, but ever on. The wounded
and the dead were left. There was blood, and
ghastly sights. A bullet sang so close over Jerry’s
head that he ducked. A shower of grape spattered
all around him. Drum Major Brown was down—his
leg had collapsed under him.</p>

<p>“Never mind me, boys.”</p>

<p>Jerry heard a cry—“Help! For th’ love o’
Hiven, help, wan o’ yez!”</p>

<p>He glanced behind. Corporal Finerty was bleeding
and struggling, on hands and knees, in a ditch
with the water almost over him. Jerry hustled back
and dragged him out; then ran forward. It was no
joke being a drummer boy in a battle, for a fellow
could do little with a musician’s short sword fit only
for frying bacon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“Double time, men! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>How they all panted, and what a sight they were,
muddy and smeared with blood and sweat.</p>

<p>“Commence—firing!”</p>

<p>“Huzzah! Give ’em Yankee Doodle, boys!”</p>

<p>The darkly scowling faces of the rows of Mexicans
behind the dike breastworks could be seen.
Their white teeth flashed from their lips parted in
the swarthy countenances flattened against the gunstocks.
The musket muzzles belched smoke; so did
the cannon of the bridgehead to the left. The soldiers
in front of Jerry were aiming, firing, pausing
to load—to tear their paper cartridges with their
teeth, dump a little of the powder into the opened
pan under the raised flint, pour the rest into the muzzle,
ram the paper and the three buckshot and
a ball home with the ramrod; aim, fire, and run
again, loading.</p>

<p>The blue line was slowly moving in. The men
worked like Trojans. Now the buttons of the rows
of red-capped Mexicans were showing, so near were
the trenches. Jerry stumbled along right behind
Lieutenant Grant, who never ceased shouting, never
ducked nor dodged, and somehow had not been
hit yet.</p>

<p>The First Brigade advance had come to a standstill,
while the ranks fired more rapidly. The Mexicans
were leaking away—wounded and staggering,
or running scot free. A tremendous cheer arose
above even the other tumult. The Second Brigade
was into the bridgehead! A torrent of blue blouses,
firing and charging with the bayonet, the officers
leading and waving, had crossed a wide ditch at its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
base on this side. The men were diving in through
the battery embrasures or scaling the walls like cats.
In they went—in by the road went the Sixth Infantry.
The flags of the Eighth and Fifth disappeared
over the top; soon the flag of the Sixth was dancing
to meet them. Out boiled the Mexicans, artillery
and infantry, and streamed in a tossing tide up the
bridge and into the north, or else into the trenches on
the west. The bridgehead had been taken by front
and side.</p>

<p>“Now, men! On! Charge!”</p>

<p>“The bayonet, lads! The cowld steel!” shrieked
old Sergeant Mulligan to Company B.</p>

<p>The drummers beat the charge; with a volley
and a yell the Fourth Infantry and all the line ran
for the dike. The Mexicans in it answered with one
volley; out they bolted. Right through the canal,
shoulder deep with mud and water, the men scrambled,
and leaped over the other bank. The Mexican
red-caps, throwing away muskets and knapsacks,
were frantically crowding the built-up road where
it crossed the lowlands beyond the bridge.</p>

<p>The bridgehead had been the key. The enemy’s
left was emptied; the trenches along the dike west of
the road were still fighting, but Duncan’s battery
had come into action. It had been unable to advance
through the cornfields; had continued by the road,
under cover of a mass of abandoned wagons from
San Antonio. It was firing from the road—never
had guns been served faster. The four pieces made
one continuous roar, cannonading the west trenches
that reached all the way to the great stone church set
in the midst of other field works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>The bridgehead’s captured guns also were being
turned. That was too hot for the Mexicans. Out
they, too, boiled, fleeing madly through the fields
to the rear.</p>

<p>Duncan’s battery and a four-pounder in the
bridgehead changed to the church and battered the
walls. The Second Division, with Taylor’s battery
of the First Artillery, was still battering from the
other side. A white flag fluttered in the smoke upon
the church’s flat roof. It vanished—it had been
hauled down. Now the Second Division line sprang
to its feet and charged. The church was surrounded
by double walls—the blue figures mounted the first
wall—the church cupola was crumbling under the
solid shot—the church was about to be taken—no!
The wall was cleared by the Mexican sharp-shooters
upon the roof. Yes! The wall filled again, the men
vaulted over and down and rushed for the second
wall—the sharp-shooters were leaping from the cupola
and off the roof—the Mexican cannon had been
silenced—there were more white flags—“Cease firing!”
pealed the artillery bugles, for the standard
of the Third Infantry, blue and gold, had unfurled
from the balcony. In a moment the standard of the
First Artillery was displayed beside it.</p>

<p>The First Division, jumbled all together, the men
cheering and waving and even crying with joy, had
paused to watch—had paused for orders, maybe, to
assault the church itself. Jerry found himself
grabbed by Hannibal—a grimy, excited Hannibal,
wild with excitement, like the rest.</p>

<p>“We did it, we did it! Hooray! And you and
I aren’t hurt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>“But we lost a lot of men,” Jerry panted.</p>

<p>“Fall in! Fall in! Form companies. Beat the
rally, drummers.” Those were the orders. Hannibal
scooted. General Worth was waiting no longer.
There was heavy firing in the north, where Santa
Anna was standing off the left of General Scott’s line.</p>

<p>“Who’s yonder?”</p>

<p>“Shields and his Mohawks, and the Pierce
Brigade. They’re hard pushed.”</p>

<p>“Forward—double time—march!”</p>

<p>The Cadwalader men had joined again. They
had entered the bridgehead closely behind the Second
Brigade. In column of platoons all doubled up the
road, which was strewn with bodies and plunder.
The rout was on before and extended as far as eye
might see; but a desperate battle was raging only a
mile distant.</p>

<p>The column was in time; in fact, may not have
been needed. The flight from the bridgehead and
the church proved too much for the Santa Anna
soldiers. General Pierce’s Ninth, Twelfth and Fifteenth
Regulars, and General Shields’ New Yorkers
and South Carolinans, two thousand men, were having
a give-and-take with General Santa Anna’s reserve
of four thousand infantry and three thousand
lancers. But before the General Worth and General
Pillow column arrived, the Mohawks were seen to
charge—the Mexicans did not stand—their line wavered,
the Pierce Regulars struck it on right and left—the
center burst apart, all the line broke into
fragments, fleeing for the road; and when the First
Brigade, led by General Worth and Colonel Garland,
panted in the Santa Anna troops had mingled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
with the vast throng of refugees from Churubusco.</p>

<p>The Pierce Regulars and the Shields’ Volunteers
met the van of the First Division.</p>

<p>“On, men! To the city!”</p>

<p>No time was granted to the Mexicans to re-form;
their infantry, artillery and camp followers jammed
the road and flowed out upon either side. Lancers
protected the rear, and threatened the pursuit.
Matters looked good. The First Division, both of
General Pillow’s Third Division brigades (General
Cadwalader’s and General Pierce’s), and the Shields
Mohawks were united, a victorious little army, and
cared nothing about the lancers; the road to the capital
was open. Hooray!</p>

<p>But—</p>

<p>“Column, halt!”</p>

<p>The drums beat, the bugles rang.</p>

<p>The column was two miles and a half from
Churubusco, and only a mile and a half from the
city gate. The Mexican rout had attempted no
stand; the foremost of its dense mob were already
jostling in. General Worth evidently was uncertain
what to do—whether to follow right on or wait for
orders. He and General Pillow and General Shields
consulted together, sitting their horses. Huzzah!
Huzzah for the dragoons! Here they came at a
gallop, from behind, under Colonel Harney, and tore
in to General Worth.</p>

<p>Colonel Harney checked them for a moment, and
exchanged a word with the general. General Worth
nodded. On spurred the little detachment—Captain
Phil Kearny’s company of the First, half a company
of the Second and two companies of the Third.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Captain Kearny led. Their pennons streamed, the
riders leaned forward in the saddles, sabers were out
and flashing.</p>

<p>Plain to view they struck the Mexican rear guard—dashed
the lancers to one side and the other, wielding
their sabers cut a lane clear to the city gate,
and disappeared in the midst of a seething mass.
Colonel Harney’s orderly bugler pelted vainly after,
blowing the recall. The Kearny detachment did not
hear. The battery and the muskets of the city gate
began to fire upon friend and foe alike. It looked
as though the dragoons were entering the gate itself.
No—back they galloped, Captain Kearny with his left
arm dangling and bloody, two other officers wounded,
and several troopers reeling in the saddle.</p>

<p>An aide from General Scott hastened in with
dispatches. General Scott directed that the pursuit
cease. The column was counter-marched a short distance
and bivouacked. Dusk was descending from
the mountains, announcing the end of a long, long
day. Suddenly Jerry and everybody else felt exhausted.
They had been upon their feet since before
daylight; had been marching and fighting for sixteen
hours, with not much to eat.</p>

<p>The first thought was “coffee.” As soon as
arms were stacked the First Division bustled to
gather wood. Down the road other divisions were
doing the same. The hospital men could be seen
searching the field of battle, far and near, for
the wounded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIX">XIX<br />
<small>BEFORE THE BRISTLING CITY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Before supper was finished the clouds had gathered;
darkness set in early, with every prospect of
rain again; the men were still too excited to lie down—they
collected in groups around the campfires and
talked things over.</p>

<p>Jerry simply had to find Hannibal and compare
notes. On his way to the Second Brigade he met him
coming on. They returned together to the campfire
line of the Fourth Regiment and squatted there.</p>

<p>The Fourth Regiment would never be the same
again. Just how many it had lost in killed and
wounded was not yet known, but in Jerry’s own little
mess Corporal Finerty was greatly missed. He and
Drum Major Brown had been put in hospital back
at Churubusco, it was said, and were due to recover.</p>

<p>All agreed that of the Regulars the First Division
had suffered the most severely. In the Second Division,
which attacked the church from the open, the
First Artillery had lost five officers; the Second Infantry
had lost four; reports from the Third and
Seventh Infantry were not in.</p>

<p>There was much praise for the new Third Regular
Division, and the Mohawks, of the Fourth Division.
In the Cadwalader brigade of the Third,
which supported the First Division against the
bridgehead, Lieutenant J. F. Irons, aide-de-camp
to General Cadwalader, had been killed. General
Franklin Pierce, leading the other brigade in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
march to oust Santa Anna, had fainted from pain.
That fall from his horse at Contreras had proved
to be very serious. The Shields Mohawks and the
Pierce Ninth, Twelfth and Fifteenth Regulars had
outbattled Santa Anna’s seven thousand. The South
Carolina Palmettos had formed center of line. Their
colonel, Colonel P. M. Butler, had been wounded,
had refused to leave, and then had been killed; their
Lieutenant-Colonel Dickinson had been mortally
wounded next, and Major Gladden had commanded.
Colonel Burnett, of the New Yorkers, had been carried
from the field. So had Colonel Morgan, of the
Fifteenth Infantry. Of the two hundred and seventy-two
Palmettos in the final charge one hundred and
thirty-seven had fallen. But General Shields had
taken three hundred and eighty prisoners.</p>

<p>Out of the seven cavalry officers who charged
with the one hundred dragoons to the city gates, three
had been badly wounded (Captain Kearny’s arm had
been amputated at the hospital), and Lieutenant
Ewell had had two horses shot under him. Major
Mills, of the Fifteenth Infantry, who had joined as
a volunteer, had been killed.</p>

<p>The whole army had been in action, except the
Second Pennsylvania and the Marines, who had
been kept at San Augustine with General Quitman to
guard the supplies; and the Fourth Artillery, who
had been ordered to stay at Contreras.</p>

<p>“’Twas this way,” old Sergeant Mulligan explained
to the listening group at the campfire: “In
wan day we’ve done what no mortal army ever did
afore. We’ve fought foive distinct battles, by daytachments,
so to speak—eight thousand of us divided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
up to lick thirty thousand Mexicans. An’ lick ’em
we did, ivery time, in spite o’ their breastworks an’
forts an’ their chosin’ their own positions. We give
’em the field, an’ then we tuk it. First there was
Contreras: thirty-foive hundred Americans ag’in
seven thousand active enemy wid twelve thousand
standin’ ready to pitch in. Second, there was San
Antonio, where twenty-six hundred of us saw mainly
the backs o’ thray thousand. Third, the bridgehead
an’ thim entrenchments, where we were outnumbered
not more’n two to wan; an’ fourth, the church, wid
the Second Division stormin’, say thray or four to
wan; an’ fifth, the Gin’ral Shields foive rigiments of
belike two thousand breakin’ the hearts o’ Gin’ral
Santy Annie’s siven thousand. Now I’d like to hear
whut Old Fuss an’ Feathers has to say.”</p>

<p>“You’ll hear him,” asserted a man from a searching
detail, who had come up from the rear. “At
Cherrybusco he is, still; proud as a king, the tears of
him choking his voice. He’s thanking every division
in turn; he’ll not forget the First that opened
the way.”</p>

<p>“And where was he during the fracas?”</p>

<p>“In the rear of Twiggs, directing the fight and
sending in the regiments. So fast he sent ’em forward
after Contreras that b’gorry he found himself
left all alone, and had to get some dragoons for
an escort.”</p>

<p>“An’ whut does he say about the desarters, I’m
wonderin’?”</p>

<p>“Desarters?” exclaimed several voices.</p>

<p>“Sure, lads. Sixty-nine were taken: twenty-seven
at the church and the rest by Shields. The artillery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
battalion o’ Saint Patrick they’re called—an insult
to the name. Every man once wore the United
States uniform, and this day they turned the guns
upon their own comrades. Tom Riley is their captain.
The most of ’em desarted from Taylor, in
north Mexico, with hopes of better pay and positions.
’Twas they who held out longest at the church.
Three times they pulled down the white flag, for they
well knew they were in a tight place. Hanged they’ll
be, as they desarve.”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” spoke somebody. “Old Fuss and
Feathers has a soft heart in him for the enlisted man.
Now if they were officers he’d give ’em short shift.”</p>

<p>“Did you find many wounded, poor fellows?”
the detail man was asked.</p>

<p>“Not near enough before darkness. There’s like
to be a hundred of the First lying now in the cornfields—and
the rain closing down.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad, bad. What with the mud and the
corn and the ditches, it must be a sore place to search.”</p>

<p>“We’re doing our best.”</p>

<p>“Well, lads,” Sergeant Mulligan uttered, “I’m
wet through already, an’ I’m goin’ to turn in, for
to-morrow we’ll likely take the city. An’ why we
didn’t go for’d an’ take it this evenin’, on the heels o’
that mob, I dunno. Wid the help o’ Shields an’
Pillow, the First could ha’ walked right along.”</p>

<p>“An’ walked into a trap, maybe. But the gin’ral
had no orders, an’ he waited too long, undecided.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and the gen’ral-in-chief stopped him, too.
Like as not that United States commissioner, by
name o’ Trist, who’s been followin’ with headquarters
all the way from Puebla, is instructed ag’in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
more fightin’ than is necessary. ‘Conquer a peace’;
that’s the word. And if we’ve conquered it this
day, we’ll give Santy Annie a chance to say so, after
he’s calmed down a bit.”</p>

<p>“Right, then,” Sergeant Mulligan agreed. “Let
’em think it over. For if we entered in too much of a
hurry ’twud be only a half-baked p’ace after all.”</p>

<p>The group broke up.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Hannibal. “Whew, but I’m
tired. It’s been a great day, though. Oh, my eye,
didn’t we thrash ’em!”</p>

<p>“Rather guess,” Jerry answered. “I kept track
of Lieutenant Grant. He was right near me most
the time.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Pompey?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen him. He’s hunting another
money chest, like as not.”</p>

<p>This night Jerry slept under a wagon, while
the rain beat down. But the thought of the wounded
lying out in the dark and storm bothered him. Battles
were not pleasant.</p>

<p>After breakfast the First Division was marched
back to Churubusco. The other divisions were encamped
nearby. And what a sight that field of
Churubusco was! The bodies of Mexicans were
piled everywhere—in the road and in the breastworks
and in the muddy fields. All the trenches and
the causeway and the road north was a mess of
muskets, pistols, swords, bayonets, lances, haversacks,
cartridge boxes, knapsacks, great coats, blankets, hats
and caps, and drums, horns, fifes and the like, enough
to equip fifty bands.</p>

<p>The Mexican loss was estimated at four thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
killed and wounded and three thousand prisoners.
Thirty-seven pieces of artillery had been taken, together
with an enormous quantity of small arms
and supplies.</p>

<p>The division was moved to the walls of the ruined
church. General Scott waited here, sitting his horse,
his rugged face now glad, now sad, but lighted
proudly. The church balcony contained a number
of captured Mexican officers, gazing down as if interested.
The general lifted his hand, while the division
cheered him. He seemed about to make a speech.</p>

<p>“Silence, men! Silence in the ranks!”</p>

<p>“Fellow soldiers,” the general shouted in his
loud voice—which trembled. “Fellow-soldiers of
the First Division. Your general thanks you from
the bottom of his heart. But a reward infinitely
higher—the applause of a grateful country and Government—will,
I cannot doubt, be accorded in due
time to so much merit of every sort displayed by this
glorious army which has now overcome all difficulties
of distance, climate, ground, fortifications and
numbers. To the First Division I say, as I have said
to the other gallant divisions, that by the abilities and
science of the generals and other officers, by the zeal
and prowess of the rank and file, you have, in a single
day, in five battles as often defeated thirty-two thousand
of the enemy. These great results have overwhelmed
him. The larger number of our own dead
and wounded are of the highest worth; the wounded
under treatment by our very able medical officers are
generally doing well. Again your general and fellow-soldier
thanks you, and he will add that this work
so well accomplished will not be concluded until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
we place the flag of our country upon the Halls
of Montezuma.”</p>

<p>“Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!”</p>

<p>The front rank broke; before the officers could
stop them the men had rushed forward and were
fighting to grasp General Scott’s hand, and even his
stirrups. He could only spur his horse in careful
fashion, and bowing and smiling, his wrinkled cheeks
wet, finally galloped away. In a few minutes he was
riding across country into the west, escorted by
Harney’s dragoons.</p>

<p>About noon it was announced that all the
wounded had been found and the bodies of the slain
had been buried. The roll calls of the divisions were
tabulated. Out of twenty-six hundred men the
General Worth command had lost, in killed, wounded
and missing, thirteen officers and three hundred and
thirty-six rank and file; total, three hundred and
forty-nine. The Mohawks of General Shields had
lost two hundred and forty out of the two regiments.
The Second Division, Regulars, had lost two hundred;
the Pillow Regulars about the same. The grand
total was one thousand and fifty-six, in which there
were eighty-four officers.</p>

<p>The First Division was marched west out of
Churubusco by a crossroad about two miles to the
next main road, which had been opened by the capture
of Contreras; then from this road, four miles
by another road northwest to a town named Tacubaya,
on the north slope of a hill only a mile and a
half from the southwestern walls of the city itself.</p>

<p>General Scott was already here with the Harney
dragoons detachment. They and the First Division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
had the advance position. It looked as though the
general was side-stepping again. Instead of moving
upon the city by the Acapulco road (the road from
San Augustine through San Antonio and Churubusco),
he was slipping around to the west and
keeping Santa Anna guessing.</p>

<p>This evening word was spread that Santa Anna
had proposed a truce for the purpose of talking
surrender. The men grumbled somewhat. A truce
appeared to them a Mexican trick, in order to gain
time while guns and soldiers were shifted. The
United States Peace Commissioner, Mr. Trist, who
had accompanied the army from Puebla, held long
meetings with the Mexican commissioners, but the
two parties did not agree upon terms.</p>

<p>The peace talks continued for two weeks. During
the truce neither army was to fortify further against
the other. Both were to get food supplies without
being interfered with. The Mexicans were to send
out for provisions; the Americans were to purchase
provisions wherever they could, even in the city.</p>

<p>The First Division occupied the advance position
of Tacubaya, and had a good rest. Drum Major
Brown and Corporal Finerty, of the Fourth Regiment,
were able to hobble about and would soon be
fit for duty. The General Pillow Third Division was
a short distance south, at another village; the Twiggs
Second Division was farther south, at San Angel; the
Quitman Fourth Division of Volunteers and Marines
was down at San Augustine, in charge of the prisoners
and the extra supplies.</p>

<p>In Tacubaya General Scott and staff were quartered
in the magnificent palace of the archbishop of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Mexico, which from the western outskirts of the town
overlooked the whole country below. Tacubaya itself
was a kind of summer resort for Mexico City;
a number of English gentlemen and wealthy city
merchants lived here in great style, with villas and
out-door baths and large gardens, enclosed by walls.</p>

<p>The slope of the hill fronted the capital. After
duties Jerry and Hannibal and the other First Division
men paid considerable attention to that view
from the slope, for many of the city defenses were
clearly outlined.</p>

<p>To the north, directly in front of Tacubaya, on
the Tacubaya road to the city and only one-half
a mile distant by air, there was a huge mass of grey
rock, connected with the city walls by two short
roads. The rock mass was fortified from bottom to
top by breastworks, and fringed at its base by a long
wall and embankment. On the flat crown, about
one hundred and fifty feet up, there was a great stone
building—the Military College of Mexico. The rock
fell away steeply on the south and the east sides. The
engineers said that it was as steep on the north side.
The west side had a more gradual slope, covered with
cypress trees. The name of the rock was Chapultepec—or
in English, Grasshopper Hill.</p>

<p>At the foot of the west slope—the timbered slope—there
was a long group of stone buildings, with
flat roofs and one or two towers. At night red
flames seemed to issue from one of the roofs, as if
the place was being used as a foundry, casting guns
and solid shot. The place was called El Molino del
Rey—the King’s Mill; and according to the people in
Tacubaya, it was indeed an old mill and a foundry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>The western half of the group was the Casa-Mata,
or Casemate. And this was reported to be a
powder storehouse.</p>

<p>The King’s Mill and the Casa-Mata were located
not only at the western foot of Chapultepec but also
at the foot of the hill-slope of Tacubaya village.
The guns of Chapultepec covered them; covered the
Tacubaya road which at the base of the rock mass
ran into the two short roads onward into the city—one
entering the city at the southwest corner, the
other farther north, on the west side; covered the
main road east of Tacubaya—the Contreras road.</p>

<p>To silence Chapultepec—perhaps to climb to its
top with only eight thousand men—looked like a
job. The King’s Mill and the Casa-Mata at its base
might have to be taken. The city gates were defended
by batteries, and they, too, would have to
be stormed.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant good-naturedly lent his spy-glass
to Jerry; through it there might be seen the
faces and costumes of the Mexican soldiers upon
Chapultepec. The castle or college itself loomed
menacing with cannon, and thick high walls and the
Mexican coat of arms in colors over the wide portico.
Numbers of boys were moving about in neat
uniforms. These were the military cadets, being
educated for Mexican army officers. Some did not
appear more than fourteen years old.</p>

<p>Evidently they had practiced on Chapultepec hill,
for as said, there was no end of ditches and breastworks,
from the college buildings down to the last
wide ditch and wall at the bottom.</p>

<small>THE BATTLE OF THE KING’S MILL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Dar’s trouble hatchin’.”</p>

<p>It was afternoon of September 7. The men of
the First Division were lying around. Pompey had
come forward to where Jerry and Hannibal were
sitting with several others, debating the course of
events. There had been no fighting since August 20,
when Churubusco fell.</p>

<p>“Gwan, you black crow!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sars. But I knows what I knows, gen’i’men.
Dar’s trouble hatchin’. Dat armorstice done
busted an’ we gwine to pop it to ’em ag’in.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Sartin. Dis chile don’t mix up with offercers
for nuffin’. The armorstice done been busted by
Gin’ral Scott hisself. Dose Santy Annies been fortifyin’
’gin the rules, an’ gettin’ reinforcements; an’
Gin’ral Scott he sent a note dis berry mornin’ sayin’
dar ain’t any armorstice any mo’ an’ Santy Annie better
look out fo’ hisself. Santy Annie, he a big liar, but
Gin’ral Scott, he a big strateegis’ an’ nobody gwine
to fool him. I heah offercers talkin’; I heah Lieutenant
Smith an’ Lieutenant Grant talkin’, same as
odders. Dar’s gwine to be a monster fight, sars.”</p>

<p>“B’gorry!” old Sergeant Mulligan exclaimed,
slapping his thigh. “That’s right; sure, that ixplains
matters. ’Tis why Cap’n Mason, of the ingineers,
was off yonder to the front this mornin’ rayconnoiterin’;
an’ there go Mason an’ Colonel Duncan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
an’ Worth an’ Gin’ral Scott himself on another trip.
I’ve a feelin’ in me bones that a fight’s due.”</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to take Grasshopper Hill for
exercise,” said Hannibal, lazily.</p>

<p>“Faith, then why don’t you tell Gin’ral Scott?”
the sergeant rebuked. “Belike he’s only waitin’ for
some smart drummer boy to make his plans for him.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to take it, haven’t we?” Fifer
O’Toole asked.</p>

<p>“Yis, barrin’ a better way. ’Tis the city we’re
after, an’ what wid? Wid an’ army o’ less than eight
thousand, to-day, outside a walled city o’ two hundred
thousand an’ dayfinded by twinty thousand,
snug beyant ditches an’ stone. A job that, me lads,
to open the gates. Thim dons know we’re up to
somethin’. Did yez mark quite a movement o’ troops
down below this mornin’? Says I to meself: ‘Gin’ral
Santy Annie is startin’ out to envelop our lift,
or else he’s rayinforcin’ the mill so as to get his
cannon matayrial finished up.’ Faith, there’s a
storm brewin’, but I’ve been in the service too long
to daypind on camp gossip. I’ve my own ways o’
findin’ out.”</p>

<p>So the sergeant arose and strolled off.</p>

<p>“Same here,” Hannibal declared. He darted
away for his brigade camp.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the correct news meself at the hospital
when I ask the doctor to take wan more look at my
leg,” Corporal Finerty, asserted, starting out with a
great pretense at hobbling.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bide a wee jist where I am,” spoke
Scotty MacPheel, smoking his pipe. “I’ve gotten a
dream, this nicht past, an’ I ken mysel’ there’ll be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
gey hot wark soon. When it coomes, I’ll no be the
last up yon hill.”</p>

<p>All seemed very peaceful in town and camp and
upon Chapultepec rock. The flags floated languidly
above roofs and tents and battlements. But danger
brooded in the air. The armistice had been broken;
everything indicated that. The engineers were reconnoitring,
as they always did before a battle.
The Mexican forces appeared somehow more alert.
Now Jerry himself got up and started out. Pompey
followed him.</p>

<p>“Where you gwine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just taking a walk.”</p>

<p>“You gwine to find Lieutenant Grant, huh? You
gwine to pester him. Lookee hyar, white boy. Don’t
you say nuffin’ ’bout me. If he or Marse Smith
find out I been tellin’ ahmy secrets, I get coht-martialed.
Understan’? Mebbe I get hanged up, like
dem desarters gwine to be.”</p>

<p>“Are they to be hung?”</p>

<p>“Sartin. Dat’s what. A coht-martial done try
’em, an’ done say dey’s to be hanged up, fo’ desartin’
in face ob the innimy an’ shootin’ deir own men.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” Jerry whistled. He hastened on.</p>

<p>He did not find Lieutenant Grant; Corporal Finerty
had learned little, Hannibal did not come back,
and Sergeant Mulligan kept mum. But all the remainder
of the afternoon the excitement in the camp
increased; the old soldiers there “smelled powder.”
The reconnoitring group returned, and there was
a council of general officers at commander-in-chief’s
headquarters. Furthermore, in the early evening
General Cadwalader’s brigade of the Voltigeurs and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
the Eleventh and Fourteenth Infantry with Captain
Drum’s battery of the Fourth Artillery had marched
in from the General Pillow’s Third Division camp,
three miles south.</p>

<p>After retreat old Sergeant Mulligan plumped
himself down at the supper mess with the words:</p>

<p>“We attack at daylight to-morrow, lads.”</p>

<p>“Where, man?”</p>

<p>“The King’s Mill an’ the Casa-Mata.”</p>

<p>“And Chapultepec?”</p>

<p>“Not as I know of. The Mill an’ the Casa-Mata
be the First Division’s job, helped out by the Cadwalader
brigade. Sure, the ould man—an’ I’m
manin’ no disrayspect—had been a-lookin’ at yon
mill from headquarters, an’ he says, snappin’ his glass
together, says he: ‘I must daystroy that place.’
Whereby he sends in the First Division, o’ course,
wid the Cadwalader troops to watch an’ see how
it’s done.”</p>

<p>“An’ what does he want of those old buildin’s,
when we might better be takin’ Chapultepec?”</p>

<p>“Becuz he can l’ave Chapultepec to wan side, if
he likes, an’ march into the city by another way. But
Santy Annie’s short o’ guns an’ solid shot—haven’t
we captured most of his movable artillery?—an’ the
report is that he’s been meltin’ up the church bells
for cannon iron. Faith, we’ll go down an’ take them,
too, before he can put ’em to use.”</p>

<p>“Wid Chapultepec firin’ into us?” Corporal
Finerty asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, what do we care for the likes o’ Chapultepec?
Ain’t ye soldier enough to know that downhill
firin’ is mighty uncertain work, especially wid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
Mexican gunners? An’ they’ll be killin’ their own
men, wance we’re inside the walls. Then wid the
fut o’ the hill cleared, we can march up all the ’asier,
in case such be the orders.”</p>

<p>“How many Mexicans this time, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Well, the ingineers an’ Ould Fuss an’ Feathers,
not to spake o’ Gin’ral Worth himself, haven’t discivvered
many, for all their reconnoiterin’ the long
day. Seems like there are cannon in the mill, an’ in
that ramshackle Casa-Mata; an’ a line o’ breastworks
are connectin’ the two. But scarce a sign o’ much
of a supportin’ force of infantry. An’ I’m thinkin’
that by an ’arly mornin’ attack we’ll walk in after
the fust scrimmage. Annyhow, we’ll get our orders;
an’ it’s soon to bed, for me, an’ a bit o’ sleep.”</p>

<p>Jerry managed to get over to the Eighth Infantry
and find Hannibal; a rather sober Hannibal.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t see you before,” said Hannibal. “I’ve
been on detail. But you know now; we’re to take
the Mill and Casa-Mata. Three o’clock in the morning
is the hour, and no reveille. So good-by and
good luck, if we don’t meet up again.”</p>

<p>“Why’s that. Will it be much of a fight, you
think, Hannibal?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. But I’m in the storming column—five
hundred picked troops from all the regiments.
We charge first and break the center. Major Wright,
of the Eighth, commands. About half the Eighth
is chosen. The Eighth is General Worth’s own regiment,
you see, and he knows what we can do.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I can get in it, too,” Jerry blurted.</p>

<p>“Don’t think so. The First Brigade has only
seven hundred and fifty men; the Second had eleven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
hundred and fifty, so we’ll furnish the most stormers.
You fellows will have enough to do, anyhow.”</p>

<p>With a “Good-by and good luck—see you later,”
Jerry shook hands and hustled back for his company.
But the men from the Fourth had already
been picked.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was no rain this night. When
Jerry, like the others, was aroused by the non-commissioned
officers passing from mess to mess, the
stars were shining brightly. The First Brigade
formed by itself, under Colonel Garland, in the early
morning gloom, and presently was marched down
the slope by a road, as if straight for the King’s
Mill. By the slight rumble of artillery wheels a
battery (Drum’s battery, it was, from the Cadwalader
brigade) followed. The other brigades might be
heard, also moving, with creak of belts and cartridge
boxes, dull tramp of feet, and low lurch and
rattle of cannon carriages and caissons. Somewhere
on the left cavalry equipment faintly jangled.</p>

<p>Colonel McIntosh, of the Fifth Infantry, was said
to be commanding the Second Brigade; Colonel
Clarke was ill. Major Wright, of the Eighth Infantry,
commanded the storming column of five hundred
men picked from all the regiments of the division.
General Cadwalader commanded the Third Division
regiments. Colonel Harney had supplied six companies
of the Second Dragoons and one company of
the Third, which with one company of the Mounted
Rifles, were under Major Sumner. There were two
twenty-four-pounder siege guns, under command of
Captain Benjamin Huger, chief of ordnance, and
three guns of Colonel Duncan’s First Division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
celebrated battery, which accompanied the Second
Brigade.</p>

<p>At San Antonio the First Division had numbered
twenty-six hundred officers and men; now it
was down to nineteen hundred, or two thousand,
when one included the Colonel C. F. Smith battalion
of Light Infantry attached to the Second Brigade.
General Cadwalader had brought about seven hundred
and fifty in his three regiments; Major Sumner’s
dragoons and Mounted Rifles numbered two
hundred and ninety, the three batteries one hundred;
so that General Worth was attacking the Mill and
the Casa-Mata with some thirty-one hundred and
fifty men.</p>

<p>After a march forward of about a mile down
the hill slope from Tacubaya, the First Brigade was
halted in line of battle.</p>

<p>“Lie down, men. Silence in the ranks.”</p>

<p>While they lay, the east brightened slowly over
the City of Mexico and the citadel of Chapultepec.
The towers and steeples of the city began to be outlined
against the sky; Chapultepec caught the glow;
all the east became gold and pink, with the mountain
ranges black along the high horizon. Down here
it was still chill and dusky. Colonel Garland, dimly
seen from his horse, addressed the line.</p>

<p>“My men,” he said, “the First Division is going
into battle as soon as there is light enough. General
Scott has appointed us to brush the enemy from those
buildings yonder. The First Brigade is to handle
the mill, where the enemy’s left rests. The Second
Brigade will assault the enemy’s right at the Casa-Mata.
The general assault will be opened after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
artillery has prepared the way by the Major Wright
storming column, which will break the enemy’s center
and cut the communications between the mill and
that powder store-house. Our own job is to isolate
El Molino and prevent aid from Chapultepec. So
we must work fast. But once in there, you know
very well that we can’t be driven out. No, no; don’t
cheer. Silence! All I ask of you is to uphold the
honor of the First Brigade and the American arms.”</p>

<p>The lower country was lightening, now. They all
could see the arrangements for themselves. The
First Brigade occupied right of line. Captain Drum’s
battery section of three six-pounders was posted a
little to the right of the brigade. Not far on the left,
or west, were the two twenty-four-pounder siege
guns of Captain Huger, with the Light Battalion
drawn up behind them in support. Beyond, in the
broken line that curved to the north so as to envelop
the breastworks and the Casa-Mata, there were the
five hundred men of the Major Wright storming
column, crouched in column of platoons, and behind
them the General Cadwalader brigade, in reserve.
Farther on in the west there was the Second
Brigade, and beyond it the Duncan battery section,
waiting in front of the Casa-Mata. And away on the
left of line in the northwest, there were the three
squadrons of cavalry.</p>

<p>Nothing had been heard from the enemy; not a
movement had been sighted. Then, suddenly, a
bugle pealed; drums rattled like a volley. The sound
made everybody jump, but it was only the regulation
Mexican reveille upon Chapultepec. Never had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
it seemed so loud, it fairly echoed against the mountains
back of the city.</p>

<p>“Boom, boom-m-m!”</p>

<p>A flare of flame and a great shock in the air took
one’s breath.</p>

<p>“Steady, men!” Lieutenant Grant and other
officers were warning.</p>

<p>Huger’s siege guns had opened; and how they
bellowed, blasting the still air so that the city crashed
and the mountains rumbled.</p>

<p>“Boom! Boom!” The solid shot might be
heard smashing through the stone walls of the old
mill five hundred yards before. Up on Chapultepec
the bugles and drums had ceased, as if frightened.
The mill did not reply. General Worth and staff,
back of the storming column, could be seen watching
the effect of the bombardment; from the mill dust
was rising into the dawn.</p>

<p>“Column—attention!”</p>

<p>The First Brigade had been craning anxiously;
the men scrambled to their feet at the command.
An aide from General Worth had galloped to the
battery; it stopped firing, and—huzzah!—the Wright
column was rushing forward at the double, down
the slope, for the bottom and the breastworks connecting
the mill and the Casa-Mata.</p>

<p>That was a stirring sight to witness: this little
column of blue-jacketed, round-capped soldiers
charging, guns at the ready, their officers leading,
and the colors streaming overhead in the fore.
Everybody cheered—waved caps and hands; the
cheering spread from the First Brigade clear to the
farthest left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>On dashed the Wright five hundred—and that
Hannibal was there, Jerry well recalled. They slackened—an
officer ran forward (he was Captain
Mason, of the engineers, who guided with Lieutenant
Foster)—he ran back, beckoning as if he had
seen nothing beyond the lines of cactus which
screened the trenches; the column hastened again,
was almost there when from a few yards the whole
fringing cactus spumed flame and smoke and a great
gush of grape and musket ball mowed the ranks down
like ninepins.</p>

<p>But they didn’t stop. No, no! The ranks closed,
with bayonets leveled they plunged straight forward
into the cactus and over the embankments and into
the trenches. The Mexican infantry and artillery
were diving right and left for shelter in the Casa-Mata
and the mill.</p>

<p>“Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!”</p>

<p>Now for the First Brigade and the seizure of the
mill! But look! A tremendous gunfire had belched
from the roof and the walls of the mill, directed into
the main trench; and a column of Mexican infantry,
numbering one thousand, had charged in counter-attack
from the rear ground.</p>

<p>Out came the Wright fragments, driven back and
back and back, and lessening rapidly. There looked
to be scarcely any officers left. Major Wright and
both the engineers were down.</p>

<p>Huzzah, though! The Light Battalion and the
Eleventh Regulars of General Cadwalader had been
launched by General Worth to the rescue—</p>

<p>“Column, forward—trail arms—center guide—double
time—march!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>It was the word for the First Brigade at last.</p>

<p>Chapultepec had opened with a plunging fire into
the valley. The First Brigade sped steadily down
the slope for the smoking King’s Mill.</p>

<p>“Charge—bayonets! Run!”</p>

<p>And run they all did, with a yell, Jerry and the
drummers and fifers pelting behind, the officers to
the fore, Drum’s battery following by the road.
Grape and canister and musket ball met them; men
fell; the firing was worse than that of the bridgehead
at Churubusco, but the Fourth Regiment luckily
found itself in an angle of the wall surrounding the
mill yard and could rally under protection. The
enemy was inside, sheltered by the walls of the mill
buildings and by sandbag parapets upon the flat roofs.
The shouting and the rapid firing announced thousands
of Mexicans.</p>

<p>All the bright morning was dulled by powder and
rent by the cheering, the yelling, and the continuous
reports of muskets and cannon. From the angle of
the wall where the Fourth crouched, the battlefield
to the west stretched full in view—the soldiers charging
down across it, staggering, limping, crumpling,
but closing ranks as they tore on, their bayonets set.
The Cadwalader reinforcements and the Light Battalion
had mingled with the shattered Wright column;
they were bearing on together, and disappeared
in the cactus-fringed trenches. What of
Hannibal, Jerry wondered.</p>

<p>But here was Drum’s battery section, dragged
forward by hand to a nearer position in the road.
It scarcely had been pointed and the linstocks applied
to the touch holes when every gunner was swept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
away by the Mexican balls, leaving the guns alone.
Led by Corporal Finerty, out rushed a squad of the
Fourth, reloaded one of the guns and discharged it
again and again.</p>

<p>The men plastered within the angle of the wall
were firing with their muskets whenever they had the
chance. Old Sergeant Mulligan was right out in the
open, lying behind a large cactus with broad spongy
lobes, and aiming and shooting and loading and aiming
once more. He did not seem to know that the
Mexican bullets were riddling the cactus lobes as if
they were paper.</p>

<p>Amidst the hurly-burly orders came to leave the
cover of the wall.</p>

<p>“Up, men! Battalion, by the left flank, left
face, double time—march!”</p>

<p>That took them to the road again.</p>

<p>“Battalion, forward! Through that gate, men!
Break it down! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Huzzah! Huzzah!”</p>

<p>Another great cheer had arisen. The Wright and
Cadwalader column had won the trenches connecting
mill and Casa-Mata; the Mexicans were pouring
out, as before—their own cannon were being turned
upon them. Now was the time for seizing the mill
at one end and the Casa-Mata at the other.</p>

<p>“Huzzah! Inside wid yez!” Sergeant Mulligan
bawled, his face red and streaming dirty sweat.</p>

<p>Fast work was made with the gate. Battered
by musket stocks and rammed by flying wedges of
human bodies it crashed apart. Through the opening
and over the walls on either hand the Fourth
Infantry surged inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>All was confusion. Jerry tried hard to stick
close to Lieutenant Grant. The yard had to be
crossed first—a very maelstrom of smoke and lead—before
the buildings themselves might be stormed.
The Mexican soldiers, firing from windows and roof-top,
gave way never an inch. They were obstinate
to-day; brave, too. But shooting, shouting, darting
by squads, the Fourth Infantry bored in. On the
other sides the rest of the brigade was fighting
stoutly also.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible that anybody could live
to reach those angry buildings. Jerry—somehow
not a whit afraid, so excited he was—wormed after
Lieutenant Grant, who surely had a charmed life.
The Grant detachment rammed through a door and
into the first room of the first building. A pioneer
with an ax had joined. Lieutenant Grant pointed,
and the pioneer hacked a hole through a wall of the
room; the lieutenant vanished into it—they all pursued,
Jerry wriggling with the others, his drum
slung on his back, his eyes smarting and watering.</p>

<p>Mexican soldiers were upon the roof above.
They could be heard yelling and firing. A door from
the second room led into an open corridor from
wing to wing. The lieutenant sprang back just in
time—a loud report had greeted him, and a bullet
had splintered the plaster in front of his nose.
Scotty MacPheel bolted forward, musket ready; another
bullet toppled him. They dragged him
into shelter.</p>

<p>“’Tis nathin’, lads,” he gasped. “But bide a
wee, for if there’s ane there’s a dozen, jist
a-waitin’ above.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>“Careful, men. Watch for a red cap, and when
you fire, don’t miss,” panted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The squad ranged themselves within the doorway
and peered; now and then fired. Two Mexican
soldiers tumbled asprawl into the corridor. After
a few moments there were no answering shots.
One of the men—Corporal John Hale—saluted.</p>

<p>“All clear, lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Follow me, then. On, boys.”</p>

<p>So they passed through the corridor into the
next wing.</p>

<p>By the noises the other troops were ransacking
rooms in the same way. The tumult, now loud, now
muffled, was filled with American cheers.</p>

<p>The next room contained Mexican soldiers driven
to cover. At sight of the entering squad they dropped
their guns, even fell upon their knees, holding up
their empty hands. “Amigo, amigo—friend,
friend!” they cried.</p>

<p>“Disarm these fellows and take them outside,
four of you,” the lieutenant ordered.</p>

<p>On through a door and another room, and the
remainder of the detachment was outside also. The
mill yard was a mass of panting blue-coats and of
herded Mexican prisoners. The guns of Chapultepec
could not fire in with safety. The battle here
was over.</p>

<p>Staring about in the north end of the yard Jerry
noted a group of red caps upon a roof.</p>

<p>“There are some more, lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“On that roof.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>The lieutenant ran for the building, Jerry after.
There was no way of climbing atop.</p>

<p>“Here, you men! Place that cart for me.”</p>

<p>A broken cart was trundled to the wall of the
building; the heavy tongue just reached the top.
<a href="#i_264">Lieutenant Grant used this as a ladder.</a> He shinned
up, Jerry following, while the men below formed file
to join.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_264">
  <img src="images/i_264.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_264">LIEUTENANT GRANT USED THIS AS A LADDER</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But somebody had been ahead of the lieutenant.
He was one man: none other than Fifer O’Toole,
parading back and forth with a musket. Fifer
O’Toole grinned.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m saving ’em for you, lieutenant,”
he reported.</p>

<p>They were a fat Mexican major and several
subalterns, with full a dozen privates; and they were
quite ready to surrender, for at sight of Lieutenant
Grant’s drawn sword they unbuckled their belts and
dropped their guns.</p>

<p>“The fortunes of war, señor,” the major said in
good English, shrugging his shoulders. “We fight
like men, but you Americans fight like demons.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” the lieutenant answered
shortly, stacking the scabbards in his arms. “Crack
those muskets over the edge of the wall, lads, and
conduct these prisoners to the proper guard.”</p>

<p>He himself lingered a minute upon the roof.
Jerry breathlessly waited. The mill had been taken.
There were only a few scattered shots among the
buildings, as the soldiers below or ranging the roofs
jumped Mexican skulkers from hiding places; but
to the west the battle was still raging furiously.
From the roof-top a good view might be had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>The trenches connecting with the Casa-Mata had
been seized; their cannon were being used to quicken
the rout hastening into the wooded west slope of
Chapultepec. All the Casa-Mata, however, was
aflame with rapid discharges, and the Second Brigade
was recoiling in confusion from before it. The
Casa-Mata turned out to be a solid stone structure,
built like a fort, housing cannon and infantry, and
surrounded by ditches and breastworks.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant chanced to mark Jerry, standing
behind him.</p>

<p>“They’re being cut to pieces,” he exclaimed.
“General Worth, and Scott, too, have been deceived.
We should have attacked in greater force.”</p>

<p>The Second Brigade was in the open—could not
penetrate past the ditches and to the Casa-Mata walls.
The field was blue with bodies. Where was Duncan’s
battery? Then a sharp word from the lieutenant,
who had leveled his spy-glass, drew Jerry’s
eyes also to the northwest at very end of line.</p>

<p>A dense body of lancers had sallied from the
Mexican right, and sweeping around was forming to
charge and turn the American left. The Duncan
battery section, with the Voltigeurs running to keep
up, was galloping to head the lancers off. And the
Sumner dragoons and Rifles were changing front to
meet the charge.</p>

<p>The battery was there first—unlimbered in a
twinkling—the lancers, a mass of red and yellow,
their lances set, tore in for it. Colonel Duncan
waited—waited—and when his guns at last burst
into canister and grape, with gunners working like
mad, the close ranks of the Mexican cavalry melted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
away in the manner of grain before a giant scythe.
The horses reared, fell, or, whirling, bore their gay
riders right and left and in retreat.</p>

<p>A new gunfire crashed from the Casa-Mata. At
the Second Brigade again? No! The Second Brigade
was still streaming rearward in blue rivulets,
which swirled, eddied, jetted smoke as the men desperately
tried to stand and fight, then slowly flowed
on. The new gunfire had issued from a blind trench
along which the Sumner column was racing. Down
went horse and rider. Major Sumner pointed with
his saber, and never wavering, the little column, terribly
thinned, dashed on for the lancers, who had
re-formed as if to charge again.</p>

<p>Back came the Duncan battery, leaving the lancers
to the dragoons and Rifles. Colonel Duncan
wheeled his guns into position before the Casa-Mata
once more. Quick work this was. He had not been
able to do as he wished here, because the Second
Brigade infantry had masked his fire, but now, with
his field cleared, his three pieces delivered one constant
sheet of smoke, out of which the solid shot and
canister sped, ripping through the walls and deluging
the parapets.</p>

<p>In a moment, as it seemed, the Casa-Mata fire
slackened; the doors and windows and roof vomited
Mexican soldiers, fleeing helter-skelter, losing hats
and knapsacks and muskets; veering to the north out
of reach from the mill, they pelted on for the San
Cosme gateway of the west city wall.</p>

<p>With a resounding cheer the Second Brigade
charged into the defenses. The flag of the Eighth
Regiment broke from the roof-top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant closed his glass.</p>

<p>“The battle is over,” he rapped. “Now we can
take Chapultepec. If General Scott has the rest of
the army in readiness we can take the city itself before
night.” Then, as he glanced quickly about:
“Aha! A counter-attack!”</p>

<p>Another body of the enemy had appeared—five
or six thousand infantry, marching in along the north
side of Chapultepec. And the lancers were threatening
the Sumner column in the northwest.</p>

<p>“We’re getting reinforcements, too, lieutenant!”</p>

<p>Down from Tacubaya village a fresh American
column was hurrying, the Stars and Stripes dancing
at the fore. Now Duncan’s battery section, Drum’s
section, the Huger twenty-four-pounders, and the
guns of the captured Casa-Mata were all thundering
at the retreating Mexicans. Bugles were blowing,
drums rolling.</p>

<p>“We’d better find our stations, boy,” said the
lieutenant. They two piled down by way of the
cart shafts.</p>

<p>Jerry was scarcely in time to help beat the recall
for gathering the men. The reinforcements arrived.
They were the General Pierce brigade—Ninth,
Twelfth and Fifteenth Infantry—of the Pillow
Third Division. Advancing at the double, amidst
cheers, they deployed beyond the mill, challenging
the enemy to come on. The new Mexican column
hesitated, and well it did so, for here was still another
brigade, sent by General Scott; the Riley Fourth
Artillery, Second and Seventh Infantry, of the
Twiggs Second Division, who from the south had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
marched four miles, mostly up hill and at the double
time to Tacubaya, and thence over and down.</p>

<p>Magruder’s battery, which had done such service
at Contreras, was with it; swerved to the
west and opened upon the lancers; dispersed them
in disorder.</p>

<p>The Mexican flight continued; the Mexican reinforcements
countermarched around Chapultepec.
The battle had been won—won by the First Division,
the Cadwalader brigade of the Third, six companies
of cavalry, Huger’s two twenty-four-pounders,
Drum’s three six-pounders, and the Duncan spit-fires.</p>

<p>The hour was ten o’clock. Who would have
thought that so much time had passed? General
Scott had come upon the field. He could be seen,
congratulating General Worth. It was not until noon
that the dead and wounded had been placed in wagons
for Tacubaya. And it was a tired but triumphant
column that finally trudged—many a man using his
musket for a crutch—up the hill and back to camp.</p>

<p>At the start the Casa-Mata powder magazine
exploded with loud burst, according to plan. The
smoke drifted into the faces of the Mexican garrison
of Chapultepec, who peered down but stuck tight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXI">XXI<br />
<small>READY FOR ACTION AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>This afternoon the camp of the First Division
and Cadwalader Brigade was proud but saddened:
proud, when the men learned that with their thirty-one
hundred they had defeated fourteen thousand
concealed within ditches and behind walls or massed
for support, with General Santa Anna himself looking
on; saddened, when they learned what the victory
had cost.</p>

<p>“The bloodiest fight, ag’in fortifications, in American
hist’ry,” old Sergeant Mulligan pronounced.</p>

<p>General Worth had acted rather blue. Out of his
thirty-one hundred he had lost one hundred and sixteen
killed, six hundred and fifty-seven wounded, and
eighteen missing—probably dead or wounded; total,
seven hundred and thirty-one, almost a fourth of his
whole number. And the list of officers was appalling:
fifty-one of the one hundred and seventy had fallen.</p>

<p>Of the First Brigade, Lieutenant Thorn, Colonel
Garland’s aide-de-camp, was severely wounded; so
were First Lieutenant and Captain Prince and Second
Lieutenant A. B. Lincoln and Assistant Surgeon
Simons, Fourth Infantry; Lieutenants Shackleford
and Daniels, of the Second Artillery, were dying,
Lieutenant Armstrong had been killed outright;
Captain George Ayers and Lieutenant Ferry,
of the Third Artillery, had been killed; Captain
Anderson wounded.</p>

<p>In the Second Brigade brave Colonel McIntosh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
who commanded, was wounded mortally; his aide,
Lieutenant Burwell, was dead. Lieutenant-Colonel
Martin Scott, leading the Fifth Infantry, had been
killed. Major Waite, commanding the Eighth Infantry,
was wounded. And so on, down through the
captains and lieutenants.</p>

<p>In the storming column Major Wright, commanding,
and the two engineers, Captain Mason and
Lieutenant Foster, had been wounded. One volley
from the Mexican breastworks had felled eleven out
of the fourteen officers!</p>

<p>The Eleventh Infantry had lost its commander
also—Lieutenant-Colonel Graham—killed. Major
Savage, of the Fourteenth, and Major Talcott, of
the Voltigeurs, had been wounded. Four officers
of the Sumner squadrons had been struck down.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant had escaped again; but Lieutenant
Frederick Dent, of the Fifth Infantry, whose
sister was said to be Lieutenant Grant’s sweetheart,
had been wounded, and the lieutenant was
much concerned.</p>

<p>Jerry, too, was on tenterhooks until he found
out that Hannibal Moss, drummer boy, was not
among the casualties. He and Hannibal met while
looking for one another. A number of comrades
were looking for one another this evening. They,
too, shook hands thankfully, and sank for a talk.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hannibal, “the First Division did it
again, but it was awful. Did you fellows have a
hard time?”</p>

<p>“Did we! Not a one of us expected to
get away alive. Expect you other fellows had it
worse, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>“The poor old Eighth Regiment Foot,” Hannibal
murmured soberly. “That hurt General Worth, I
guess, to see us cut up so. We’ve lost ten out of
twenty officers. The storming column didn’t hear a
sound from those breastworks—didn’t see a sign of
life, hardly, beyond the cactus. It was the same with
the Second Brigade at the Casa-Mata. Then when
we were right at the trenches, the Mexicans opened
on us, just mowed us down. Eleven officers of the
fourteen! Think of that! I got two bullets through
my uniform and a handful through my drum. See
those holes? Talk about ‘brushing away the enemy!’
My eye! Old Fuss and Feathers was fooled for once.
We didn’t gain much.”</p>

<p>“We showed what we could do again.”</p>

<p>“You can’t show those Mexicans anything. Listen
to that music?” For the bells of the City of
Mexico were ringing madly. “The bells weren’t
in the mill at all. Now they’re being rung for victory,
because we didn’t take Chapultepec. The Mexicans
think we stopped short, and they’re celebrating.”
Hannibal shook his grimy fist at the city. “You wait
till we get breath,” he warned.</p>

<p>“Suppose we’ll take Chapultepec next.”</p>

<p>“I dunno.” And Hannibal wagged his head.
“This division ought to be given a rest. We’re
reduced almost to fourteen hundred. Since we
started in at San Antonio we’ve lost eleven hundred
men, some sick, but mainly killed and wounded. The
whole army’s lost only nineteen hundred. I guess
the First has done its share of fighting.”</p>

<p>“That leaves General Scott with about eight
thousand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>“Nearer seven thousand in the field. And Santa
Anna has twenty-five thousand still, I’ll bet a cooky.”</p>

<p>“We’ve licked that number before. Odds don’t
make any difference to Scott men.”</p>

<p>“Not much they don’t,” Hannibal agreed. “One
more of these little ‘brushes’ and we’ll be in the
Halls of Montezuma.”</p>

<p>All the able-bodied troops were paraded at nine
o’clock the next morning, September 9, to witness
burial. A long trench had been dug just outside the
village of Tacubaya. The wagons, covered with
United States flags and bearing the bodies of the
killed in the battle of the eighth, were escorted by
funeral squads from each of the regiments. The
fifes and drums and a band, playing the funeral
march, accompanied; the troops followed with
muskets at a support. The tattered battle flags had
been draped with crape. The cannon fired minute
guns in solemn fashion.</p>

<p>General Scott and staff, and all the general and
field officers, stood with heads bared; the troops, in
a half square, presented arms, while the Episcopal
church burial service was read by Chaplain “Holy
Joe” Morrison. Then the sappers and miners filled
in the trench.</p>

<p>It was a bright day. The high parapets of Chapultepec,
to the north, were thronged with Mexican
soldiers looking down upon the ceremony.</p>

<p>“B’gorry, you’d better be attindin’ your own
funerals,” old Sergeant Mulligan growled at them,
when the parade had been dismissed.</p>

<p>Following the battle of Molino del Rey, General
Scott seemed to be in no hurry to take Chapultepec.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
Rather, he acted as though he might side-step Chapultepec.
The First Division and the Cadwalader
brigade rested at Tacubaya. The other Third Division
brigade—that of General Pierce, who was still
in the hospital with his crippled knee—under General
Pillow himself had been moved about two miles east,
where with the Riley brigade of the Twiggs Second
Division it was covering the city’s southern gates.</p>

<p>The engineers of Captain Lee were down there,
also reconnoitring.</p>

<p>“Dar’s gwine to be anodder big battle,” Pompey
kept insisting. “Gin’ral Scott, he got somepin’ up
his sleeve.”</p>

<p>Before daylight of September 12, Jerry, in the
camp of the First Brigade, was half-awakened by the
tread of marching feet in the dusky outskirts of
Tacubaya. At reveille they all might see that there
were two camps between Tacubaya and the city. The
Pillow camp had been transferred nearer and was
established down toward the King’s Mill in front of
the town; while a second bivouac appeared not far
on the east or right of it under Chapultepec.</p>

<p>The General Quitman Fourth Division had
arrived at last from San Augustine: Brigadier-General
Shields’ New Yorkers and South Carolinans,
and Lieutenant-Colonel Watson’s Marines and Second
Pennsylvanians! Now the only troops left in the
rear were General Persifor Smith’s brigade of the
Second Division, being the First Artillery, the Third
Infantry, and the dismounted Rifles. But Taylor’s
light battery of the First had come up, it was said,
and so had General Twiggs.</p>

<p>There was another suspicious sight. During the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
night batteries had been emplaced down in front of
Tacubaya and facing Chapultepec. They seemed to
be four sections, in pairs. One pair, about to open
up, was located on the right of the hill slope, near
the Quitman division and the road leading from
Tacubaya to the eastern foot of Chapultepec. The
other pair, not yet quite ready, was located near the
King’s Mill and the Pillow brigade. The engineers
and the artillerymen had worked all night planting
the batteries.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning, but—</p>

<p>“Boom! Boom-m-m!” The heavy reports
jarred the breakfast cups and platters, and rolled
back from the castle and the city walls and the mountains.
Everybody sprang up to see the shots land.</p>

<p>“Boom! Boom! Boom-m-m!” They were two
eighteen-pounders and an eight-inch howitzer of
Captain Huger’s ordnance—a twenty-four-pounder.
Dust from the pulverized stone and mortar floated
above the castle of Chapultepec—dirt and rock
spurted from the breastworks of the hillside—the
Mexican soldiers were ducking and scampering. The
men cheered.</p>

<p>“Now let ’em tend to their own funerals, and
we’ll play ’em Yankee Doodle.”</p>

<p>The other battery joined. The bombardment of
Chapultepec continued steadily. The Riley brigade
of General Twiggs remained in the east upon the first
main road from the south there, which entered the
gate in the southwest corner of the city wall—the
Belen gate. Old Davy’s two batteries, Taylor’s, and
Steptoe’s Third Artillery detached from the Fourth
Division, were peppering the gate and also firing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
upon the Mexican batteries protecting the Contreras
and Churubusco roads, still eastward. The ringing
of musketry faintly chimed in with the loud booming
of the cannon.</p>

<p>And this was Sunday!</p>

<p>Just what General Scott had “up his sleeve” nobody
among the rank and file knew. The officers
refused to talk. Matters looked as though Chapultepec
was to be shaken first, and when it had been
well battered, then of course there would be an
assault. But where? Perhaps upon the southern
gates, in defiance of the weakened Chapultepec.</p>

<p>From the hill of Tacubaya the bombardment was
pretty to witness. The American guns poured in
their shot and shell with perfect aim, so that after
every discharge the stones and dust and dirt were
lifted in showers. From half a mile the citadel replied
lustily, at first with ten pieces, but the firing
was wild. Gradually the guns were being silenced;
the garrison was drifting out for safety, and a large
body of reinforcements from the city had halted part
way to the hill, waiting for a chance to enter.</p>

<p>The First Division men off duty began to sift
down nearer to the batteries to get, as Corporal
Finerty remarked, “a smell o’ powder.” Jerry,
Fifer O’Toole and Hannibal caught up with the corporal
on the Tacubaya road. They four stood
behind battery Number 1, which was the two
eighteen-pounders and the twenty-four-pounder
howitzer, commanded by Captain Drum, of the
Fourth Artillery.</p>

<p>A group of the Palmettos was here. It was good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
to see the Mohawks again. Palmettos, New Yorkers,
and Keystoners—they had a fighting reputation.</p>

<p>“Howdy?” the South Carolinans greeted easily.
They were a set of men who usually said little.</p>

<p>“Same to you,” Corporal Finerty answered.
“An’ faith, you’ve been a long time comin’. For
why do yez trail through by night, wakin’ up a camp
that’s tired wid hard fightin’?”</p>

<p>“Well, pardner, you talk like you want to hawg
all the fun,” they replied. “To-morrow we’ll see
who’s first up that hill—the Volunteers or you Regulars.
Even start, my bucko.”</p>

<p>“If you know annything, out wid it,” Corporal
Finerty demanded. “Do we storm Chapultepec,
you say?”</p>

<p>“Would we make a forced march by night for
less, Mister Regular?”</p>

<p>“Sure, now, what’s the use o’ foolin’ wid Chapultepec?”
retorted the corporal. “Let the ar-r-tillery
tind to that, an’ wait a bit an’ we’ll open thim
southern gates for yez, so yez can come in at ’ase.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind those south gates. It’s Chapultepec
or nothing, for the army’s going in by the
west. The engineers decided that long ago. We
heard the talk at the battery before you fellows
were up. Those roads from the south are no good,
Mister. Every one leads through marshes and is
flanked by ditches and cut by batteries and other
ditches, and there’s a thundering big canal running
’round the city walls. And the marshes and the
ditches and the canal are full o’ water. So ’tis this
way, Mister: we-all and the Pillow men scouted
about yesterday, backing up Twiggs, for a showing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
ag’in the south. But we were ordered to trapse hyar
in front o’ Chapultepec by night, leaving only Old
Davy and his Riley brigade for a feint. And to-morrow
we-all are going to see the elephant on top
o’ yonder hill.”</p>

<p>“B’gorry, you could fetch no better news, lads,”
spoke the corporal. “There be fourteen hundred o’
the First Division lift, to turn their backs on the rist
o’ the army an’ their faces on the enemy.”</p>

<p>“Nary, corporal,” they answered. “The Palmettos
have something to say to that. It’s been
powerful slow, pardner, sitting in the south whilst
you fellows in the north have been burning powder.
The Fourth Division will be first up that hill or bust.”</p>

<p>An aide from Captain Huger, who directed the
general bombardment, rode along the line of batteries
waving the spectators back.</p>

<p>“You can’t stay here, men. By orders of Captain
Huger the field must be cleared. You’re furnishing
the enemy with too large a mark.”</p>

<p>So they all had to leave.</p>

<p>The bombardment, increased by the batteries on
the mill side, continued all day and closed only with
darkness. The citadel of Chapultepec appeared to
have been pretty well “shaken.”</p>

<p>“’Tis cruel hard on thim young cadets,” said old
Sergeant Mulligan at supper mess. “I hear tell that
some of ’em are mere lads scarce able to showlder
a musket. Now I wonder if they aren’t bein’ sint
down to the city to their mothers, where they
belong. I’m hopin’ so. We don’t want to be after
killin’ boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant passed along the line of company
fires.</p>

<p>“Parade the men for inspection at eight o’clock,
sergeant,” he instructed, “in light marching order,
with cartridge boxes filled and two days’ rations.”</p>

<p>“For the love o’ Hiven, left’nant,” the sergeant
pleaded at salute, “tell me: Do we be takin’
Chapultepec?”</p>

<p>“The First Division has orders to support the
Pillow assaulting column on the west. The Quitman
division, supported by the General Smith brigade
of the Second, will assault on the south.”</p>

<p>“Support, ye say, left’nant? But we get into it,
don’t we, sorr? They won’t l’ave out the ould
First Division?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t been left out of anything lately, as
I notice,” Lieutenant Grant grimly replied.</p>

<p>The sergeant reseated himself.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, lads,” he said. “We’ve wan or
two good fights raymainin’ in our packs, I guiss.
Enough to shame those daysarters wid, I’m thinkin’.
You’ve heard they’ve been put through—a part o’
thim—already?”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Two days since, back at San Angel in the Second
Division camp. Sixteen of ’em hanged, an’
nine dishonorably dismissed by order o’ Gin’ral Scott,
wid a big ‘D’ branded on their cheeks. The rist’ll
be attinded to soon, now. But sure, boys, I’d rather
be amongst those who be hanged than amongst the
traitorous livin’, condemned to hear the sound o’ the
guns o’ Chapultepec firin’ on brave men bearin’ the
flag o’ my country.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXII">XXII<br />
<small>STORMING CHAPULTEPEC</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The First Division spent the night at the King’s
Mill. The Cadwalader brigade joined its comrade
brigade of the Third Division, and General Pillow
moved down to the mill also, in readiness for the
assault by the west slope of Chapultepec rock.</p>

<p>Before the First Division companies had been
dismissed for the night, by orders of General Worth
two hundred and fifty men and ten officers had been
told off as a storming party to serve with the
Third Division in attacking Chapultepec. Captain
McKenzie, of the Second Artillery, was to be
the commander.</p>

<p>Old Sergeant Mulligan figured among the happy
ones accepted.</p>

<p>“Hooray! Thirty years I’ve worn the uniform,
an’ to-morrow’ll be the best day o’ my life. Ah, boys!
I’d climb that hill by meself wid only a shilaly,
rather’n stay below.”</p>

<p>“You have the luck of the mess, sergeant,” they
admitted. “Now, couldn’t you sneak a few of us
along with you?”</p>

<p>“Faith, mebbe there’ll be work for you the same.
Not into the city we are yet. But I’ll have a grand
view of it from atop the big buildin’ high on
yon rock.”</p>

<p>Except for the two hundred and sixty as storming
column, the First Division was to remain below in
reserve. That was a disappointment. Jerry heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
himself growling about it with the others. Hannibal
had not got in on the attack either—but Hannibal
had been with the storming column of September 8,
when the mill and Casa-Mata had yielded, and he
ought to be willing to give place to somebody else.
Captain Gore, and Lieutenant Smith, and Lieutenant
Grant had missed out also. The Fourth Regiment
had supplied Lieutenants Rogers and Maloney;
and Company B had supplied Sergeant Mulligan, the
“top” sergeant of the whole division.</p>

<p>Jerry cogitated. The column had been made up—was
under orders to report to General Pillow before
the engagement in the morning. There seemed
no hope for the rest of them.</p>

<p>The night was rather noisy, with considerable
skirmishing by outposts, and a constant movement
upon the hill, as though the enemy was getting ready,
too, for the morrow.</p>

<p>In the pink of the morning the bombardment by
the heavy batteries reopened. General Twiggs’
guns, on the roads from the south to the city gates,
likewise went into action. The Mexicans were trying
to reinforce Chapultepec again, and they had
occupied a long trench behind the wall at the foot of
the cypress grove just east of the mill.</p>

<p>The two heavy batteries here, one in the mill and
one south of it, were firing away upon Chapultepec,
but General Pillow made other preparations. He
stationed two pieces from Magruder’s First Artillery
battery, under Second Lieutenant Thomas J.
Jackson, to watch the same cavalry column that had
threatened in the northwest at the battle of September<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
8 and now seemed inclined to come in<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.
And he directed that two of Lieutenant Reno’s
mountain howitzers (of the Callender battery which
had won fame at Contreras) be placed to shell the
Mexican long trench.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Second Lieutenant Thomas J. Jackson became the celebrated
“Stonewall” Jackson, Confederate general in the
Civil War.</p>

</div>

<p>The storming column of the First Division stood
formed, carrying scaling ladders, fascines or bunches
of fagots for filling ditches, pickaxes and crowbars.
The Voltigeurs and the Ninth and Fifteenth Infantry
under General Cadwalader were to support the
storming column. The Eleventh and the Fourteenth
were to support Lieutenant Jackson’s battery section
and head off the cavalry gathered in the northwest.
The other regiment of the Third Division, the
Twelfth Infantry, and the Third Dragoons had been
left to guard Tacubaya and one of the supply
bases south.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast another American column
appeared, marching in for the south side of Chapultepec.
It was the General Persifor Smith brigade of
General Twiggs’ Second Division: the First Artillery,
the Third Infantry, and the Mounted Rifles
afoot. The Quitman Fourth Division of Volunteers
and Marines and the Smith brigade were to assault
the rock of Chapultepec from the south and the
southeast, while the Pillow men assaulted it from the
west. The Colonel Riley brigade of the Second
Division—the Fourth Artillery, the Second Infantry
and the Seventh Infantry, with Taylor’s First
Artillery battery and Steptoe’s battery of the Fourth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
Artillery—were to hammer the south gates as a blind.</p>

<p>The army for action numbered about seven thousand.
The Mexicans were supposed to be defending
Chapultepec with seven batteries and seven breastworks,
manned by two thousand to six thousand
troops. And Santa Anna had fifteen or twenty thousand
troops in reserve.</p>

<p>The wait proved very long. The heavy batteries
thundered, sprinkling the castle of Chapultepec and
the entrenchments with solid shot and shell. The
Lieutenant Reno howitzers paid especial attention
to the wall at the foot of the hill and the ditch behind
it. The roof-tops of Tacubaya and of all the buildings
extending along the Tacubaya road to Chapultepec
were black with spectators; the walls and roofs
of the City of Mexico were crowded like the seats
of an amphitheater.</p>

<p>The sun was high when, at a quarter to eight
o’clock on this morning of September 13, two aides
galloped out from General Scott’s headquarters in
Tacubaya. Down they came, the one straight for the
Quitman column, the other for the mill. They paused
an instant to say something to the heavy batteries,
and continued at full speed.</p>

<p>“General Pillow! The commander-in-chief’s
compliments, and he directs that when the batteries
cease firing, in a few minutes, you will at once proceed
with your column to the attack.”</p>

<p>General Pillow faced his troops.</p>

<p>“Attention! We are about to storm the hill, my
lads. We shall take it with the bayonet in thirty
minutes, remember.”</p>

<p>“Huzzah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly every battery was quiet. The silence
fell like a blanket.</p>

<p>“Voltigeurs, forward! Run!”</p>

<p>In two detachments, led by Colonel Andrews and
Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph E. Johnston, the eight
companies of Voltigeurs or Light Riflemen sprang
out, rifles at a trail.</p>

<p>“Ready, Captain McKenzie. Ready, General
Cadwalader.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston’s detachment had
charged on the right for a break made by the howitzers
in the wall. The Colonel Andrews detachment
charged straight ahead. So quick they all were
that they had received only one volley from the ditch
at the edge of the cypresses before the Johnston
men were through the break and inside the defenses,
and the Andrews men were scrambling over the wall
itself. The ditch had been enfiladed in a twinkling;
the Mexican infantry dived out and scampered into
the trees.</p>

<p>The howitzers changed fire to the trees; one gun
limbered up to advance by rushes—</p>

<p>“Stormers and infantry, forward! Double
time!”</p>

<p>General Pillow dashed on with them upon his
horse. The storming column, bearing their fascines
or fagot bundles and ladders—two men to a ladder—passed
close to the Fourth Infantry. Without a word
Jerry darted from place (he simply could stand still
no longer) and beating his drum ran to the head
of the platoons.</p>

<p>He thought that he heard shouts—angry shouts;
but he did not care. His heart was thumping and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
heavy batteries had opened again, deluging Chapultepec;
so he may <em>not</em> have heard.</p>

<p>Captain McKenzie espied him.</p>

<p>“What’s this? What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“You’ll need a drummer, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who sent you in?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then go back immediately. Fall out!”</p>

<p>Jerry stepped aside; the column hurried by. He
heard another voice. It was that of Sergeant
Mulligan.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the sergeant, with a wink, “we’ve
no time to waste argufyin’. Wance in the trees, an’
nobody’ll see ye.”</p>

<p>Captain McKenzie was before and busy; probably
had forgotten all about the matter. The other
officers also had eyes and ears mainly for the front.
The Cadwalader regiments were close behind. In
the scramble over the wall there was a mixup. Jerry
stuck. Worming on again he made for the storming
column once more.</p>

<p>Rifles and muskets were cracking ahead. The
Voltigeurs, searching the trees, yelled and fired; the
enemy replied. The storming column, outstripped
in the race, pressed faster. Assuredly in this hubbub
no one would bother about a drummer boy.</p>

<p>General Pillow on his horse pushed to the fore.
The Mexican skirmishers and the infantry from the
ditch could be glimpsed, scurrying out of the timber
for shelter higher up. The howitzers were coming—they
tore through, horses tugging, cannoneers shoving,
and from above the Mexican guns were throwing
grape and shell down the hill into the wood. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
boughs of the trees cracked and slithered; the
twigs flew.</p>

<p>The storming column, laden with the ladders
and fascines and tools, did not move as rapidly as the
light riflemen. Jerry, excited to his finger tips,
scarcely knew what he was doing, but he wished to
get out of that awful mess of falling trees and blinding
smoke. Soon he found himself up with the
Voltigeurs, as they emerged into the rock-strewn
open at the farther edge of the wood.</p>

<p>Now there was a redoubt or system of fortified
entrenchments halfway on to the castle. That it was
which was pouring out the canister and shell to
sweep the slope below it. General Pillow’s horse
reared and turned, while the general tried to control
it and shout his orders. The Voltigeurs, leaping from
boulder to boulder, taking what shelter they could
get, left a wake of dead and disabled. This fire
from above was fearful—a constant stream of lead
and iron. Was the attack to be stopped? Where
were the stormers and the two regiments of infantry?
Toiling up as fast as they could.</p>

<p>General Pillow toppled free from his horse, which
bolted. Jerry reached him where he had half set up
bleeding from a grape shot through his chest, and
supported by an aide.</p>

<p>“The reserve, quick!” he gasped. “Where’s
Worth’s aide? Tell him to have Worth bring up his
whole division and make great haste or he’ll be
too late.”</p>

<p>The group scattered. Jerry, legging recklessly,
as luck would have it met Lieutenant Wood, General
Worth’s aide, galloping in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>“Lieutenant Wood! Here, sir. General Pillow
asks help. The whole division, sir. Quick!”</p>

<p>“Did he say so?” demanded Lieutenant Wood,
reining short.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He’s wounded.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Jerry Cameron, sir; drummer, Company B,
Fourth Infantry.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wood whirled his horse and sped
down for the mill. Jerry panted back for General
Pillow, but the general had not waited. The Voltigeurs
were acting as if crazy. They were shouting
“Vengeance! Vengeance!” and were charging the
redoubt, a squad of them carrying General Pillow on
a stretcher of rifles and a blanket. He had refused
to be taken rearward.</p>

<p>The rocky slope below the redoubt was alive
with the riflemen, yelling, firing, stooping and rushing.
But they slowed up—they took to cover—they
could not outface the blast of musketry and grape.
What next? Huzzah! Here was the support at last:
the storming column and the Fifteenth Infantry.
With a cheer and a volley the Fifteenth charged,
bayonets leveled, straight for the redoubt, while the
two howitzers, hauled by their cannoneers, unlimbered
against the north angle, and the Voltigeurs
rallied to storm from the right.</p>

<p>On went Jerry behind the gallant Fifteenth. The
Fifteenth piled in, the Mexicans broke in flight to the
north and the city. Jerry piled in. A Mexican
officer had stooped to touch a slow-match to the
fuse of a mine, but the musket balls hurled him
aside, wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>The redoubt had been seized. What now? The
ranks looked small, the castle wall was far above.
The charge had advanced only half distance to it.
The storming column had dropped their ladders in
their mad race to join the fighting. Here came
General Cadwalader to take command, his horse
afoam. While waiting for the ladders with which
to scale the castle walls, the men distributed themselves
as best they could for shelter from the plunging
fire of the castle. They and the howitzers replied
briskly. But here came the panting, cheering
Ninth, bringing the ladders.</p>

<p>The heavy batteries in the valley were still bombarding
the castle.</p>

<p>“The enemy’s weakening, men! Forward!”
General Cadwalader shouted. He may not have been
heard; the men knew, anyway. The Voltigeurs, led
on their left by Colonel Andrews, on their right by
Lieutenant-Colonel Joe Johnston, plunged into the
open, to fight up the steep slope to the castle.</p>

<p>The storming column was hot after; deploying,
the Ninth and the Fifteenth followed hard. Jerry,
shouting and beating his drum regardless of tune,
ran with the rest. They were not going to wait for
the reinforcements from the First Division. Off to
the south another battle raged, where the Quitman
men were busy.</p>

<p>The front line worked its way clear to the outer
wall of the castle. There the Colonel Andrews Voltigeurs
crouched in holes and behind rocks and picked
off the gunners and sharpshooters upon the parapets.
The detachment under Lieutenant-Colonel Joe
Johnston filed rapidly to the right for the southern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
face of the wall. Cheers drifted up from below. The
reinforcements were nearing.</p>

<p>But the stormers and the Ninth and Fifteenth,
with the ladders, arrived first. The Voltigeurs had
been halted by a wide deep ditch at the foot of the
wall. The bundles of fascines were passed forward
and tossed into the ditch by the stormers for pathways;
squads of men rushed with the ladders; fell;
rushed again—Look! Lieutenant Armistead, of the
volunteer stormers from the Sixth Regiment, had
planted his ladder! Down he sank, wounded—his
men swarmed up nevertheless—other ladders were
in place—some lurched aside or were hurled back—the
Mexicans upon the walls threw hand grenades,
stabbed with swords and bayonets and fired downward,
but men were climbing to them hand over hand
like monkeys, paused for an instant to shoot and stab
and club, then disappeared. By tens and twenties the
files mounted and leaped over, faster and faster;
and the next thing that Jerry knew he was inside,
himself.</p>

<p>Huzzah! The reinforcements had joined. They
were the Clarke Second Brigade—they bore the
colors of the Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Infantry.
Jerry dimly saw Hannibal in the ranks of the Eighth.
There was a company of the Quitman New Yorkers,
also—and of Marines, who somehow had got mixed
in with the right of the brigade on the way up.</p>

<p>The space within the walls on the west and southwest
of the castle formed a large yard. All the
yard fumed with smoke from the belching castle and
from the return fire.</p>

<p>The Reno howitzers had been dragged in, the captured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
guns of the outer wall were being reversed.
The storming squads with the ladders ran, heads
down, across the yard for the castle walls; the Voltigeurs
and the infantry regiments (the New York
company and the Marines, too) fired furiously from
cover or in the open, helping the cannon drive the
castle defenders from parapets and windows. The
clangor was prodigious.</p>

<p>Jerry seemed to see everything at once: the
struggling flags, the waving swords of the officers, the
figures, rising, falling, rising and charging on; the
red caps of the Mexican soldiery and the pompons
of the boy cadets fringing the parapets and the windows;
the cannon and the muskets smoking, and the
bodies now and then sprawling in a lax heap.</p>

<p>Huzzah! Somebody was up—an officer in blue,
his head bare, the flag of the Eighth Infantry at his
back. He was Second Lieutenant Joseph Selden, of
Hannibal’s company. A moment he stood, but for
only a moment. Down he fell, sweeping his party
from the ladder. The wall had been saved. Not for
long, though! Huzzah! The great embroidered
flag of the castle had drooped; a grape shot had
severed its staff. No—it was hoisted again; a slender
little fellow—a Mexican military cadet—had
wriggled up the staff and refastened the banner.
Brave boy! The troops cheered him.</p>

<p>Now there was another, louder cheer. The parapets
were being occupied by fighting blue coats. Two
flags had been planted: a Voltigeur flag and a New
York flag, upon a terrace, by two officers. The
Voltigeur officer was Captain Barnard; the New
Yorker was said to be Lieutenant Mayne Reid. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
men were battling their way through, everywhere—into
the doors and windows and over the portico and
the cornices. Another officer—Major Seymour, of
the Ninth—springing high, tore down the Mexican
colors from the broken staff; the Stars and Stripes
rose in their place.</p>

<p>The Mexican soldiers were crying “Quarter!”
or fleeing. Among them were many of the cadets.
There was another hearty cheer; the banners of New
York, South Carolina and Pennsylvania were tossing
over a mass of blue jostling through a breach in the
out-walls on the south and southeast, and charging
into the yard. General Shields was here, his left
arm reddened.</p>

<p>The castle of Chapultepec had been taken, but
heavy firing continued in the east. The Marines
and the General Persifor Smith brigade, of the Second
Division, were being held by batteries down
toward the road on that side. The cannon of the
castle were turned in that direction; they and muskets
and rifles volleyed into the backs of the enemy.
Now the Marines were fighting hand to hand with the
nearest battery. The Mexicans burst from the breastworks,
went streaming for the northeast and the city.
The Marines came on.</p>

<p>“Cease firing! Cease firing, men!” Officers
were running around, striking up the musket barrels
with the flats of their swords. “It’s all over. Don’t
fight; cheer. Leave those poor wretches alone.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIII">XXIII<br />
<small>FORCING THE CITY GATES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>General Bravo, commanding the castle, had surrendered
his sword. A young New Yorker, Lieutenant
Charles Brower, was conducting him to General
Quitman, who had just arrived. General Pillow
was here, pale and breathing hard and unable to
stand. He had been carried right along with
the column.</p>

<p>All was confusion, of shouting soldiers, waving
their caps and capering and shaking hands; of
wounded, both Americans and Mexicans—the
bravest among them being the little Mexican cadets;
of officers trying to rally their companies, and so
forth and so forth. Eight hundred prisoners were
assembled under guard.</p>

<p>Jerry heard excited talk. The Voltigeurs of Lieutenant-Colonel
Joe Johnston claimed to have been
the first to plant a flag; the New York company, of
Lieutenant Mayne Reid, disputed. The Volunteers
were singing their “Green grow the rushes, O!” The
Palmettos had charged up the hill without firing a
shot; the bayonet was their weapon. News flashed
thick and fast. Colonel Ransom, of the Ninth Infantry,
had been killed. So had Major Twiggs, of the
Marines—brother to Old Davy—while leading a
detachment of Volunteers in the Quitman two storming
columns. The Quitman stormers had lost both
their commanding officers, for Captain Casey, of the
Second Infantry, had fallen also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>In the Pillow storming column Lieutenant
Rogers, of the Fourth Infantry, was dying; so said
Sergeant Mulligan; Lieutenant J. P. Smith, of the
Fifth Infantry, was dead; Lieutenant Armistead, of
the Sixth, who had placed the first ladder, was
badly wounded.</p>

<p>But here was Hannibal.</p>

<p>“How’d you get on top?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Guess I ran off.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll get a jolly good wigging for it.
You’ll get the guard-house. No, maybe you won’t—not
after a victory. But wasn’t that a fight?”</p>

<p>“I should rather say!”</p>

<p>“The old Eighth is cut up again. Lieutenant
Selden was first on the castle, though. They don’t
think he’ll die. Lieutenants Longstreet and Pickett
and Merchant are wounded. Longstreet was carrying
the regimental colors.”</p>

<p>“Where’s my brigade?”</p>

<p>“Down below. Worth had to keep somebody,
didn’t he? We aren’t into the city yet. Hurray!
There’s Old Fuss and Feathers!”</p>

<p>General Scott had arrived. What a scene <em>that</em>
was! The soldiers acted more crazed than ever; they
thronged about his horse as they had thronged at
Churubusco; they cheered and waved and cried. He
tried to speak—he tried to grasp their hands—he
was almost dragged from the saddle. His cheeks
were wet, his eyes brimming.</p>

<p>“Fellow soldiers!” he shouted. “You have this
day been baptized in blood and fire, and you have
come out steel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>He made his way to the castle stairs, and dismounting
went inside through the portico.</p>

<p>“Come on,” Hannibal bade. “Let’s go on up.”</p>

<p>They followed in with the cheering men. The
roof of the castle was flat. General Scott had taken
position here, and was examining the country below
with his glass. It was a stirring view to all. To
the right or east there was a broad smooth road,
divided through the middle by a many-arched aqueduct
or stone conduit for water, connecting the east
foot of the hill with the city wall; to the left there
was another broad road, with aqueduct, diverging
northeast for the city wall farther in the north.
This was the longer road, say a mile. And both roads
were jammed with the Mexican troops retreating
from Chapultepec in two red and blue and yellow
and green currents, with the darker blue of the
American reserve swirling on, after an interval,
in pursuit.</p>

<p>The roads were dotted with smoke bursts of gunfire
from batteries in action. The angle between the
two roads likewise was dotted with islands of smoke,
where other Mexican batteries essayed to stay the
American columns by flank fire.</p>

<p>“Those are our fellows on that north road,”
Hannibal asserted. “There’s your First Brigade, I’ll
bet; ’Leventh and Fourteenth of the Third Division,
too. They’re making for the San Cosme gate. Some
of Quitman’s troops are following up on that
Belen gate road. Must be the Smith brigade of
the Second.”</p>

<p>“I’m going down to my regiment,” Jerry exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
“That’s where my place is, with
the Fourth.”</p>

<p>General Scott had turned to an aide and was
speaking rapidly. His great form had swelled, his
keen gray eyes shone bright with pride and hope.</p>

<p>“Direct General Clarke to march his brigade at
once and unite with the other troops under General
Worth. The Worth column is to push on as fast as
possible and clear the road to the San Cosme gate.
Heavy artillery will be sent to him from the siege
batteries.” And to another aide: “Direct General
Cadwalader to detach his Ninth Infantry, of the
Pierce brigade, to the support of General Quitman
on the Belen road. The Fifteenth Infantry will
occupy Chapultepec. With his own brigade he will
be prepared to support General Worth.”</p>

<p>The two aides hastened away. Hannibal was
as quick.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he cried to Jerry. “We’ll all be
there. You can fall in with the Eighth.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not afraid. I’ll go back with the
storming column.”</p>

<p>They rushed down together into the yard.</p>

<p>The recall for the Second Brigade regiments was
being sounded by the drums. The soldiers hustled.
Jerry found the Captain McKenzie stormers and
joined the ranks. The captain glanced sharply at
him and half smiled.</p>

<p>“You’re liable to arrest, you young rascal, for
deserting your company,” he uttered. “Report to
your proper command as soon as we get down.
What’s your regiment?”</p>

<p>“The Fourth Infantry, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>“Very good.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes they all were descending from
the hill top. The storming column took the route of
a long flight of white stone steps leading down to the
San Cosme road on the north. Several soldiers from
the First Brigade had come up to see the battlefield.
Jerry recognized Sergeant Reeves, of Company B,
of the Fourth.</p>

<p>“Hello, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself. What you doing here? Absent
without leave, eh?”</p>

<p>“I came with Captain McKenzie in the charge.
How’d you get up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just wanted to look around. The brigade
halted below for orders; and after a scrimmage
I ran up the steps.”</p>

<p>“Will we take the city, now, you think?”</p>

<p>“It’s the time,” said Sergeant Reeves, who was
a quiet man, enlisted from Ohio. “You’ll see the
First Division go in by the San Cosme gate before
sundown.”</p>

<p>“Have you had much fighting, sergeant?”</p>

<p>“Considerable with what force was left us. We
managed to get along after you quit us. One drummer
more or less—what does that amount to? I
hear that a general court-martial is going to sit on
you.” And Sergeant Reeves laughed. “Well, we
were ordered to turn Chapultepec by the north and
cut off the enemy in that quarter. Magruder’s battery
section got in a tight place in the advance.
Lieutenant Jackson lost all his horses and half his
men by grape. The Fourteenth Infantry supported,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
and Trousdale, its colonel, was shot twice. But the
road’s open to the next turn for the city.”</p>

<p>The reinforcements from the hill of Chapultepec
caught up with the main column. The stormers
rejoined their companies. Drum Major Brown
scowled at Jerry as he fell in with the field music
of the Fourth, but had no time to say anything, for
there were orders.</p>

<p>With the First Brigade leading, and the Fourth
Infantry as honor regiment at its head, the column
marched by platoons on up the wide San Cosme road,
divided through the middle by the stone arches of the
aqueduct. Six companies of Second Dragoons,
under Major Sumner, closed the rear, behind
Duncan’s battery.</p>

<p>Mexican breastworks had been erected across the
road before. They reached from ditch to ditch.
The Fourth Infantry was deployed on right and left
as skirmishers, and stealing from arch to arch the
men advanced.</p>

<p>But the battery had been abandoned. In the
final rush there were only a few scattered shots from
skulkers. The Fourth deployed again, Company B
first, and presently was fronted by a second battery,
located where the San Cosme road and aqueduct entered
a road from the west and turned with it straight
east for the city.</p>

<p>The battery parapet had a single embrasure for
one gun. But at the juncture of the two roads
houses began, facing the south and then soon extending
thicker and thicker on both sides of the road clear
to the San Cosme gateway, five hundred yards. The
flat roofs were protected by sandbags and fringed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
with the red caps of Mexican sharp-shooters. The
battery and the fortified roofs looked like an ugly
obstacle, especially as the Fourth Regiment skirmishers
were working along swiftly and leaving the
column behind.</p>

<p>Captain Gore and Lieutenant Grant, of Company
B, were well ahead of the skirmishers. Bullets droned
in, glancing among the arches. On the west side of
the San Cosme road, where it met the road from the
west, there stood a house in a large yard enclosed
by a wall. The wall skirted both roads. Now Lieutenant
Grant had daringly darted across to the south
end of the yard, scurried along the wall to the southwest
corner, and turning it, disappeared.</p>

<p>He came running back to the road; must have
called for volunteers. The skirmishers of the Fourth
fired briskly at the red caps upon the nearest roof-tops.
Under cover of the firing a dozen men bolted
to the lieutenant; at a trail arms they all followed
along the wall again and turned the outside corner.
A company of the Second Artillery sprang out of a
ditch there and joined them.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes there was a volley from
the road beyond the one house and the battery.
The Mexicans upon the roofs overlooking leaped off
and scampered for positions eastward. The battery
was evacuated in a jiffy. The Lieutenant Grant
squad and the Second Artillery company appeared
in the rear of the battery; by rushes among the
arches of the aqueduct they pursued the Mexicans.</p>

<p>With a yell the Fourth charged to the support.
Huzzah! More roofs were being emptied. The road
east to the city gate opened. On, men! On! Third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
Sergeant Bloss forged to the fore with the regimental
colors. The men tore after, Jerry and nimble little
Tommy Jones footing with the fastest. It was a
go-as-you-please, for the field music and all. Look
out! Look out! Another battery—and ready for
action, too. A blast of grape whistled down the
road, rattled against the arches in which the men
sought cover. Steady, men! Watch sharp. He’s
up to mischief this time.</p>

<p>“Bang!” A cry arose. Bloss was flat! The
grape had met him when, bearing the colors, with
the color guard he had made a dash for shelter of
a vacant house across the road. The tattered blue
and gold banner of the Fourth was in the dust. Out
charged the Mexican infantry, yelling like Indians,
to capture the flag. That would be a trophy indeed.
In charged the nearest men of the Fourth to rescue
it. Bullets flew, hissing and spattering.</p>

<p>Jerry thought of nothing but the flag. Somehow,
there he was, clutching at it in the hurly-burly—helped
by Tommy Jones, was dragging it aside,
while bullets sang in his ears and bayonets clashed
over him. And entirely out of breath he was safely
behind an arch, and delivering the flag to Captain
Gore!</p>

<p>“You’ll get mention for this, sir,” the captain
panted. “The regiment would have been eternally
disgraced.” He ran for the mêlée again.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Tommy?” Jerry gasped. With
a word and a slap on the shoulder Corporal Finerty
had taken the flag to carry it.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy. “And you saved the honor
of the regiment. You were there first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“You helped.”</p>

<p>“Bet you’ll never be hauled on the carpet for
skipping off this morning,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>And Jerry rather thought the same. Whew! If
the Mexicans had got that Fourth Infantry flag,
which had been pierced with twenty-six balls at
Monterey and as many more at Churubusco and
the King’s Mill!</p>

<p>The regiment and the Second Artillery company
had taken the breastworks, but the drummers before
were beating the recall. The Fourth numbered only
two hundred and fifty men, the Second Artillery company
only forty. The scant three hundred of them
were here alone, fronting the garita or gate of San
Cosme, not more than two hundred and fifty yards
down the road.</p>

<p>Between the breastworks and the garita the road
was lined on both sides with the stone, flat-roofed
houses, defended by sandbag parapets and the Mexican
infantry. Another battery at the gate commenced
to pepper the road. Grape and canister
whizzed by.</p>

<p>“Fall back, men! Fall back! We can’t hold
this now.”</p>

<p>Running and dodging and pausing to fire, the
Fourth and Captain Horace Brooks’ artillery company
withdrew by way of the arches and the last
houses. Laughing and puffing, they reached the
head of the main column.</p>

<p>General Worth had halted the column at the
juncture of the road from the south and the road
from the west, beside a large cemetery called the
Campo Santo. The cemetery was the one used by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
the English residents of the city for burying their
dead. General Scott and his staff had come up.
He and General Worth were sitting their horses at the
head of the column and surveying the road, which
from here stretched eastward five hundred yards
through the suburbs to the San Cosme gate.</p>

<p>“You will press right on, general,” Old Fuss
and Feathers abruptly said. “Carry the gateway in
the shortest time possible and penetrate as far as the
Alameda, three squares from the grand plaza. General
Cadwalader is on his way and will act as reserve
while holding his brigade here in the Campo Santo.
Siege guns have been ordered up for you.”</p>

<p>That was all. General Scott galloped back toward
Chapultepec. The Cadwalader Voltigeurs
and the Eleventh and Fourteenth Infantry were
double-quicking in, bringing the Reno howitzers.
The Eleventh and Fourteenth proceeded to take
position in the Campo Santo. The Voltigeurs were
directed to support the howitzers and attack with the
First Division. The dragoons had been ordered to
guard Tacubaya headquarters, it was said.</p>

<p>Jerry felt hungry. The sun marked mid-afternoon
already. There was very heavy gunfire in the
southeast around the Belen gate. Clouds of smoke
enveloped the gate. The Quitman column had
stormed—officers with glasses were insisting that the
gate had been forced and that the Mexicans were
trying to drive the Quitman column out. But the
First Division had its own work now.</p>

<p>“Colonel Garland!” Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp
Pemberton, from General Worth, was delivering
orders. “By direction of the division commander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
you will kindly equip a sufficient detachment
of your brigade with pickaxes and crowbars, advance
your column by the right of the road to the first occupied
building, and using your sappers hew a way
straight through the line to the gate. The same
methods as at Monterey, colonel. When you reach
your objective break through the roof and open fire
from above the gate. The Second Brigade will be
doing likewise on your left.”</p>

<p>The First Brigade, which had been hugging the
aqueduct arches, cheered the orders. The detachment
of sappers was told off, and supporting the
pick-and-crow men the Fourth Infantry, followed by
the Second and Third Artillery, rushed for the first
house. The skirmishers deployed, seeking cover behind
walls and sheds while they busily popped at the
Mexican red caps upon the roofs.</p>

<p>The sappers hacked holes through the side of the
house; by squads the men dived in. Jerry stayed
out with the rest of Company B, his eye again glued
to Lieutenant Grant.</p>

<p>Through the houses, and behind walls and around
corners, the First Brigade slowly traveled on. The
houses stood more and more closely, so that the burrowers
darted safely across the narrow spaces. The
enemy atop was helpless to stop them—and had no
time to attend to them anyway. Jerry soon overtook
Lieutenant Grant, who had halted at one side
and was gazing before from the angle of a garden
wall.</p>

<p>He saw Jerry at his elbow.</p>

<p>“You’re here, are you, young bodyguard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>“That’s all right. I can use you. Supposing
some of us mounted a light gun in the belfry of that
church yonder. We ought to do execution. What
do you think?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. That would be a fine place,” Jerry
agreed.</p>

<p>The church was located one hundred yards toward
the city wall and off at the south side of the
road. It had a flat roof and a belfry; but the Mexican
sharpshooters favored the houses that commanded
the road and had let the church alone.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant acted at once.</p>

<p>“Very well, we’ll try it if we can get the gun.
You run back, sir, to the howitzer battery, and ask
for a gun and gun crew. Tell them I’ll be responsible
for the report to General Worth.”</p>

<p>Jerry ran, ducking, and wondering whether he
would have to cross that fearful road up which iron
and lead were streaming from the San Cosme gate
battery. He was lucky; met, first, a lieutenant of
Voltigeurs—</p>

<p>“Here! Where you going, bub?”</p>

<p>“I want a howitzer, sir. I’m under orders from
Lieutenant Grant, of the Fourth.”</p>

<p>“You are? What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“He’s going to put it in the belfry of that church,
sir. Then we’ll be above the roofs and the gate.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant took a look. He was as smart as
a whip.</p>

<p>“By thunder, a good idea! I’ll get the howitzer.
You wait here.”</p>

<p>“And a squad to serve it, sir,” Jerry anxiously
called after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll serve it, you bet!”</p>

<p>The lieutenant returned at full speed with the
gun dismantled and a squad carrying the pieces.
Lieutenant Grant’s face lighted as he saw them hustling
in to him.</p>

<p>“Now for it, then! You’re Lieutenant——?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Fry, of the Voltigeurs.”</p>

<p>“I’m Grant, of the Fourth Infantry. Shall you
take command, or I, sir?”</p>

<p>“You, of course, lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Follow me with the gun, men.”</p>

<p>They all made a wide detour to the south to avoid
bullets. The ground was a marshy meadowland,
knee-deep with ooze, and cut by the usual ditches,
some of them breast deep. But nobody stopped for
these. When they arrived at the church they were
a slimy party. The rear door was locked. Lieutenant
Grant rapped with the hilt of his sword. A priest
opened, for barely a crack.</p>

<p>“You speak Spanish?” the lieutenant asked of
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! Tell the father that we wish to get
inside.”</p>

<p>“He says that he’s sorry, but it’s impossible at
this hour,” Jerry interpreted after the priest’s answer.</p>

<p>“Tell him that nothing is impossible to Americans.
Tell him we regret to trouble him and we do
not wish to damage property needlessly, but if he
doesn’t open the door we’ll break it down and he
may find himself a prisoner.”</p>

<p>The priest opened and stood aside. He did not
look especially friendly as they trooped by him. Up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
into the belfry they climbed, led still by Lieutenant
Grant. The men had hard work to hoist the pieces
of the howitzer up the ladder, but they did it. They
put the barrel upon the carriage and the carriage
upon the wheels, and proceeded to pass up the powder
cartridges and shells.</p>

<p>When the gun had been assembled and the gun
squad was prepared, the belfry had little spare
space in it.</p>

<p>The gun was loaded, pointed—Lieutenant Grant
himself squinted over the barrel. He stood back.</p>

<p>“Give it to ’em!” he barked. “Fire!”</p>

<p>“Bang!” The lock string had been jerked. The
shell flew true; exploded in the very midst of the
gateway battery.</p>

<p>It created a little panic. The Mexicans seemed
to think that it had dropped from the sky. The
belfry squad cheered and reloaded.</p>

<p>“Bang!”</p>

<p>The lieutenant occasionally changed to the roof-tops
and sprinkled them with canister. He was
enjoying himself immensely. So was Lieutenant
Fry. Jerry likewise was glad that he had come.
Below the belfry the whole battlefield was outspread.
The church was almost directly south of the breastworks
that had been taken and left again. The
gateway—arched over between towers, was two
hundred and fifty yards at the rear of the breastworks.
It had mounted a heavy gun and a howitzer,
emplaced behind sandbags and stone abutments and
scoured the road with shell and canister and grape.
The square towers and the parapets of the wall on
either side of the gate were volleying with musketry;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
the roofs of the houses along the road gushed smoke.
The figures of the Mexican defenders, lying flat or
crouching, or stealing from point to point, could be
plainly seen amidst smoke spume.</p>

<p>Up the street there were the Voltigeurs, supporting
the howitzers and springing from arch to arch.
Duncan’s battery, posted farther back but gradually
coming nearer, was responding hotly to the Mexican
battery. In the yards of the houses the skirmishers
of the Fourth, and of the Second and Third Artillery,
darted hither thither, picking off the Mexican sharpshooters
before them; every now and then the burrowing
squads burst out in a new spot.</p>

<p>Across the street the Clarke brigade was doing
the same work. A second howitzer had been mounted
upon a high roof over there, in rivalry with Lieutenant
Grant’s howitzer. It, too, was dropping
shells into the enemy.</p>

<p>And yonder, a mile and a half or two miles in
the southeast at the Belen gate, the other battle was
being waged, where the General Quitman column
appeared to have gained a foothold.</p>

<p>The sun was touching the western horizon. The
ammunition for the little howitzer was almost spent.
But a great cheer arose from below. They gazed
quickly. Drawn by galloping horses, the gunners
astride and lashing, or sitting upon the caisson, a six-pounder
from Duncan’s battery was charging down
the road for the abandoned breastworks.</p>

<p>The city gate spouted flame and smoke afresh.
Every Mexican musket, as seemed, was brought to
bear upon the bounding, thundering gun. Would
the gun make it—would it—would it? The two lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
horses were fairly lifted from their feet by the canister;
the other two horses dragged them, a mass of
mangled flesh. The gunners astride had been hurled
from their seats; the caisson showed gaps, as the
gunners sitting upon it wilted. Down sprawled the
horse of the young officer who commanded. He staggered
to his feet and ran on. An instant more and
the gun was safely within the shelter of the battery
parapet—was being unlimbered and turned muzzle to
muzzle with the gateway guns.</p>

<p>Of the nine artillerists, five were out of action.</p>

<p>“That,” said Lieutenant Grant, breathing fast,
“is Lieutenant Harry Hunt, of the Second. I
never saw a braver deed.”</p>

<p>The roofs of the houses had been cleared well-nigh
to the city wall. Lieutenant Hunt’s gun opened
point blank upon the gateway battery. And listen!
See! There was another great cheer—suddenly
the roofs right against the wall on either side of the
gate had upheaved, a torrent of blue caps and blue
jackets spurted out like bursts of water, and broke
white with a terrific fire into the gateway battery
and even over the wall itself.</p>

<p>The battery was silenced in a moment as the
gunners fell or frantically scuttled back through
the arched passage. Lieutenant Hunt’s gun again
belched grape. And here came the stormers, out
from among the houses and down the road, yelling,
firing, pouring through between the gate towers.</p>

<p>“The gate’s taken, and so is the city,” Lieutenant
Grant rapped. “Come on, Fry. We’d better
join our commands. Disassemble the piece, men,
and report with it to Lieutenant Reno.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>He and Lieutenant Fry and Jerry tumbled below;
ran for the road. The Fourth Infantry was
well inside the gate; the men, breathless, laughing,
peering, asking what next. Save for a few shots the
place was singularly silent. General Worth arrived
in haste.</p>

<p>“What regiment is this?”</p>

<p>“Fourth Infantry, sir.”</p>

<p>“God bless the Fourth Infantry. Where’s
Major Lee? Hold your position, major; you will
be supported.”</p>

<p>“B’gorry, first in, an’ here we stay,” cried
old Sergeant Mulligan. “Hooray for the Fourth!”</p>

<p>The enemy was rallying. His bugles pealed, his
officers were shouting and urging, a column boiled
into the street before. As quick as thought the
two guns of the gateway battery had been reversed—“Clear
the way, there!”—and a shower of grape
scattered the column.</p>

<p>The bugles sounded again, with the Mexican
signal for recall.</p>

<p>The other regiments thronged in: the Second
Artillery, the Sixth Infantry, the Eighth (with Hannibal
rolling his drum and cheering lustily), the
Third Artillery, the Fifth Infantry, the Voltigeurs;
all the Worth foot. Then, after the troops had
been assigned to position, Captain Huger, of the
ordnance, and two heavy guns, a twenty-four-pounder
and a ten-inch mortar came on; were
planted in the gateway, General Worth overseeing.</p>

<p>Save for the tolling of bells, the distant cries of
frightened people, and the muffled notes of Mexican
drums and bugles, the city was quiet. Now what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span></p>

<p>“Get your range by the map, captain,” spoke
General Worth to Captain Huger. “Then throw a
few shell in the direction of the plaza and capital
buildings. I don’t particularly care where they
land, as long as they notify the authorities that we
are here and have the city at our mercy.”</p>

<p>“Cut your fuses for sixteen hundred yards,”
Captain Huger ordered. “With shell, load!”</p>

<p>“Number One, ready! Fire!”</p>

<p>“Boom!” The twenty-four-pounder had
spoken. “Crash!”</p>

<p>“Number Two, ready! Fire!”</p>

<p>“Boom-m!” And—“<em>Crash</em>!”</p>

<p>That was the big mortar bomb. Darkness had
gathered. The flames from the two guns redly illuminated
the gateway littered with spoil—shone upon
the bodies of the Mexican gunners who had fallen,
rammers in hands; the explosions of the shells
lighted the roofs and towers in the center of the
city, almost a mile eastward. The distant cries of
alarm echoed anew. Three shells were thrown
from the twenty-four-pounder, five from the mortar.</p>

<p>“That will do,” General Worth bade.</p>

<p>An aide from General Scott raced in.</p>

<p>“General Worth! The general commanding
sends his compliments, and the information that
General Quitman is in possession of the Belen gateway.
You are directed to entrench yourself here
before the San Cosme gate, and await further orders
in preparation for a final assault in the morning,
if necessary.”</p>

<p>General Worth smiled.</p>

<p>“My compliments to General Scott. As you see,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
we have entered the city and have a clear road to the
plaza. My instructions were to penetrate as far as
the Alameda; but owing to the darkness we will
establish ourselves where we are, and march on
by daylight.”</p>

<p>The aide delayed a moment.</p>

<p>“General Quitman forced the Belen gate shortly
after one o’clock, general,” he said. “But he has
been held fast ever since, unable to advance by
reason of batteries opposing him. My congratulations
to you, sir.”</p>

<p>“He was simply to threaten the gate, I understood.”</p>

<p>“I had the honor of bearing him those very
instructions,” laughed the aide; “with the commander-in-chief’s
compliments. But before I had
delivered the message he snapped: ‘Tell General
Scott I have no time to listen to compliments,’ and
on he went.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” General Worth responded, “you
will please inform Major-General Scott that there is
nothing to obstruct my command in a forward movement
to the plaza at daybreak.”</p>

<p>The Colonel Riley brigade, of the Fourth Artillery,
Second and Seventh Infantry, and Taylor’s
battery, from the Second Division, marched in.
This night the Fourth Infantry was quartered in a
large house on the main street from the gateway.
The men reveled in the luxury of soft beds, thick
carpets, and rich food. They searched the rooms
for money but found none; and they did nothing
worse than pillage a pantry of sweet preserves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>Major Lee and invited officers fell heirs to a
supper waiting for one of the Mexican generals.</p>

<p>Jerry met Pompey wandering about, his black
face smeared.</p>

<p>“Am dis one ob the Halls ob Montyzumy?”
Pompey asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, Pompey. But we’ll be there
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Not dis chile. No, suh! You-all can have
the rest ob dose Halls; I gwine to stay hyar as long
as dar’s any platters to lick.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIV">XXIV<br />
<small>IN THE HALLS OF MONTEZUMA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At reveille it was reported that shortly after
midnight the mayor and city council had surrendered
the city to General Worth. They said that Santa
Anna had withdrawn his army into the country.
General Worth forwarded the delegates to General
Scott at Tacubaya, and he had just been directed
to march his troops to the Alameda. The Quitman
column was to occupy the plaza and raise the flag.</p>

<p>This seemed hard, but General Quitman had
been first to seize a gate, and had lost heavily.
Besides, with his Mohawks and Marines he had
guarded the rear, at San Augustine, through a long
period, while other troops were winning honors.</p>

<p>The First Division, the Voltigeurs and the Riley
brigade were halted in column of companies in the
green square or Alameda. Now all the way on
to the plaza, three blocks, the broad street was
crowded with the Mexican citizens, jostling along
the walks and thronging the balconies. The front
of many of the buildings flew the neutral flags of
England, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock music was heard and cheering.
The Quitman column appeared in sight: the handsome
General Quitman and bluff General Twiggs,
and staffs, with escort of cavalry, at its head; then
in serried ranks the Rifles, with the regimental flags
of the First Artillery, the Third Infantry, the New
Yorkers, the Marines, and the Ninth Infantry
following at the fore of their commands. Sections<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
of the Drum and Steptoe batteries rumbled behind.</p>

<p>The drums of the Worth regiments rolled, the
men cheered gallantly. With measured tread the
Quitman column passed on, its bands playing “Hail,
Columbia!,” “Washington’s March,” and “Yankee
Doodle.” Presently there was a still louder burst of
cheers, and the united strains of the “Star Spangled
Banner.” From the flag pole of the national palace
the Stars and Stripes had broken out; raised, as was
afterward learned, by Captain Roberts of the Rifles.
He had been foremost in the Quitman storming
columns up Chapultepec hill.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Beauregard, of the engineers, bandaged
from a wound, dashed from the plaza, evidently
bearing dispatches. About eight o’clock the
clatter of hoofs sounded. The Dragoons were coming.
Then—</p>

<p>“Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah for
Old Fuss and Feathers!”</p>

<p>General Scott, plumed and girted and gloved, in
full uniform complete, towered at the front. Led
by Colonel Harney and Major Sumner, the dragoons,
their mounted band in the advance, at a carry
sabers, filled the street from curb to curb. They, too,
were spick and span.</p>

<p>“Hail to the Chief!” That was the tune being
played. The general and escort swept by at a rapid
trot, while the bands and the field music of the
Worth column likewise played “Hail to the Chief.”
The Mexican spectators forgot themselves, and
cheered and clapped. No one could deny that the
chief and his cavalry made a splendid sight.</p>

<p>“Column—forward—quick time—march!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>The Worth men might move in at last. The
street was so blocked that the end files of the companies
were obliged to brush the people from the
way. In the plaza the Second Dragoons band was
playing “Yankee Doodle.” The plaza also was
crowded. There seemed to be hundreds of blanketed,
dirty beggars under foot. The dragoons rode
right and left, clearing the plaza with the flats of
their sabers, but careful to harm nobody.</p>

<p>“Column, halt!”</p>

<p>Just as General Worth was about to give orders
a volley burst from the top of a building; the balls
pelted in, aimed at him and his staff; but they passed
over. Colonel Garland clapped his hand to his side,
and in Company B Lieutenant Sidney Smith
sank limply.</p>

<p>As if the volley had been a signal other shots
sounded; paving stones rained down. It looked like
a trap. Here were five thousand Americans, almost
the whole army, in the plaza and surrounded by
buildings and two hundred thousand people.</p>

<p>The orders were quick. In an instant Duncan’s
battery and the Reno howitzers galloped to the
plaza corners; Steptoe’s and Drum’s and Taylor’s
guns were being unlimbered. Aides from General
Scott were spurring hither thither; skirmish squads
were being told off, and ordered to search the streets
and buildings. The dragoons galloped. The howitzers
battered the building from which the first
volley had issued. Now all around the plaza there
echoed the clatter of hoofs, the thud of running feet,
and the ringing reports of musket and rifle.</p>

<p>A number of leading Mexican citizens apologized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
to General Worth and General Scott, and
offered help to put down the insurrection. The
trouble-makers were two thousand convicts who
had been set free by Santa Anna.</p>

<p>The firing in the streets continued throughout
the day, while the reserves waited under arms. At
night things had quieted somewhat. The First
Division bivouacked in the Alameda. After strong
outposts had been placed the men might talk again.
What a two days, September 13 and 14, that had
been! And this was the end of the campaign in the
Halls of Montezuma.</p>

<p>The Riley men, quartered with the First, could
tell the news from the Quitman column. They had
been at Chapultepec, and upon the road to the Belen
gate. The casualties were heavy. Major Loring,
of the Rifles, had lost an arm. The Drum battery
had been cut to pieces at the gate—Captain Drum
and First Lieutenant Benjamin killed. Lieutenant-Colonel
Baxter, commanding the New Yorkers, was
dying; Major Gladden, commanding the Palmettos,
was wounded. General Shields’ wounded arm was
in bad shape. General Pillow would recover; was in
the hospital at Chapultepec. The South Carolinans
were holding the Belen gate; the Second Pennsylvanians
were garrisoning the fort inside.</p>

<p>Colonel Garland, it was said, would get well; but
Lieutenant Smith was dead.</p>

<p>Jerry looked at his own mess. Brave Scotty
MacPheel was gone; so was Henry Brewer—he had
been shot down yesterday. Corporal Finerty bore
an honorable wound; Fifer O’Toole’s head was bandaged—a
musket ball had scraped it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p>In taking Chapultepec and the city ten officers and
one hundred and twenty rank and file had been
killed; sixty-eight officers and six hundred and
thirty-five rank and file had been wounded; twenty-nine
men were missing; total, eight hundred
and sixty-two, of whom almost a tenth were officers.
The loss to the army since it had marched
out of Puebla was three hundred and eighty-three
officers, two thousand, three hundred and twenty
rank and file. Subtracting the garrisons and rear
guards, Old Fuss and Feathers had marched into
Mexico City with less than six thousand out of
his ten thousand with which he had left Puebla six
weeks before.</p>

<p>And according to estimates, in the same time the
Mexicans had lost more than seven thousand killed
and wounded, thirty-seven hundred prisoners including
thirteen generals, some twenty flags, one
hundred and thirty-two pieces of artillery, and
twenty thousand small arms.</p>

<p>So here the “gringo” army was.</p>

<p>Instead of permitting his men to pillage the
city, General Scott levied a money contribution upon
it of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, for the
support of the troops. Adjutant Mackall read
to the First Division, paraded to listen, the following
orders:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="padr2 smcap">Headquarters of the Army,</span><br />
Mexico, Sept. 14, 1847.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">General Orders No. 284.</span></p>

<p>1. Under the favor of God, the valor of this
army, after many glorious victories, has hoisted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
colors of our country in the capital of Mexico and
on the palace of the Government.</p>

<p>2. But the war is not ended. The Mexican army
and Government have fled, only to watch an opportunity
to return upon us in vengeance. We must,
then, be upon our guard. Companies and regiments
will be kept together and all stand on the
alert. Our safety is in military discipline.</p>

<p>3. Let there be no drunkenness, no disorders,
and no straggling. Stragglers will be in great danger
of assassination, and marauders shall be punished
by court-martial.</p>

<p>4. All the rules so honorably observed by this
glorious army in Puebla must be observed here. The
honor of the army and the honor of our country call
for the best behavior on the part of all. The valiant
must, to win the approbation of God and our country,
be sober, orderly, and merciful. My noble
brethren in arms will not be deaf to this hasty appeal
from their general and friend.</p>

<p>5. Major-General Quitman is appointed the civil
and military Governor of Mexico.</p>

<p>By command of</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Major-General Scott.</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr35 smcap">H. L. Scott,</span><br />
Act’g Ass’t Adj. Gen.</p>
</div>

<p>“Well, boy,” said Hannibal, when he and Jerry
got together after dismissal, “you heard those
orders. Maybe the war’s not ended for General
Scott, but it’s ended for me. I want to rest up.”</p>

<p>“It’s ended for Pompey, too, all right,” Jerry
added. “He’s still crying about Lieutenant Smith.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
Says he’s lost his ‘offercer,’ and he wants to
go home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Hannibal mused. “And the war’s been
ended for Lieutenant Smith and a lot of good men
before him. That’s the way. War costs.”</p>
